# 39. Combination Sum

The backtracking code is mind-fuck! 

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates, target):
        def dfs(start, path, target):
            if target == 0:
                # If we've reached the target, add the current path to results
                result.append(list(path))
                return
            for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
                if candidates[i] > target:
                    # No need to continue if the candidate exceeds the target
                    break
                # Include the candidate and continue searching
                path.append(candidates[i])
                dfs(i, path, target - candidates[i])
                path.pop()
        
        candidates.sort()  # Sort candidates to improve efficiency
        result = []
        dfs(0, [], target)
        return result

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
candidates = [2, 3, 6, 7]
target = 7
print("Combinations:", solution.combinationSum(candidates, target))
# Output: [[2, 2, 3], [7]]
```

## Understanding the `path.pop()` Mystery

We have the example `[2, 3, 6, 7]`. When we call `dfs(i, path, target - candidates[i])`, it means we are including the candidate that `i` is pointing to. For simplicity, let's assume `i = 2`, which means it points to `6`. 
This means there will be a DFS run where `6` is part of the `path`, and we already do the `target - candidates[i]` when we initiate the DFS.

What you need to understand is that the DFS run above is **separate**! That run will execute independently, and we don't need to worry about it in the current context. 
After initiating this DFS that includes `6`, we proceed to **skip** the `6` in our current `path`. This is exactly what the code `path.pop()` is doing. We remove the `6` from `path`, adding or removing from the `path` does not affect the logic functionality in any way, `path` variable is just there to add accepted answer to result. 
After doing the `path.pop()`, the magic happens when we go back to the loop. The loop increments `i`, so now `i = 3`, which points towards `7`.

Since we removed the `6` from `path` previously, and we only *initiated* the DFS using `dfs(i, path, target - candidates[i])` when `6` was included, our original `target` remains unchanged in this context. Notice how we did not alter the `target` before â€” by doing `target - candidates[i]` while calling DFS, we just *initiated* a new DFS with a new `target` *if* `6` were included.

Now, the `path` may look like `[2, 3]` because we removed `6`. When we execute `path.append(candidates[i])`, we add `7`, making the `path` `[2, 3, 7]`. This `path` variable is basically used to build combinations to add into the result; it doesn't affect the actual function or logic of the algorithm. The **core** of the algorithm and code lies in the call `dfs(i, path, target - candidates[i])`, where we do not modify the original `target` variable but instead *initiate* a new instance of DFS with the adjusted `target` if we choose to include a candidate.


### Explanation of Approach:

1. **Sorting the Candidates**: We sort the candidates array to enhance efficiency. This allows us to stop further exploration as soon as we encounter a candidate that exceeds the current target.
2. **Base Case**: If the target becomes zero, we add the current path to the results as it represents a valid combination.
3. **Backtracking**: We add a candidate to the current path and recursively explore further by reducing the target. After exploring, we remove the last candidate (backtrack) and try the next candidate.

### Time & Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^T/M), where N is the number of candidates, T is the target value, and M is the minimum value in candidates. This represents the complexity of exploring all combinations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(T/M) for the recursion stack and storing the valid combinations.

## Intuition

The Brute Force code:

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        def brute(target, path: list):
            if target < 0:
                return
            if target == 0:
                res.append(path.copy())
                return
            for c in range(len(candidates)):
                path.append(candidates[c])
                brute(target-candidates[c],path)
                path.pop()
        brute(target, path=[])
        res = list(map(lambda x: tuple(sorted(x)), res))
        return list(set(res))
```

We try every possible candidate. The result will have duplicates like this:

```
[[2,2,3],[2,3,2],[3,2,2],[7]]
```
So we remove them using `sort`, `set` and return the `list`.    
This code is `O((n+k)^n)` time complexity + sort + set to list conversion
separately. However, with some changes the TC can be improved to `O((2+k))^n`.

In the *efficient code*, you will notice that we introduced a `start` variable.
This variable now, helps us not repeat the already used elements from the 
candidates list.

```python
for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
```

This will modify the decision tree in the following way:

**Key Differences**

**In-Efficient Loop:**
- Iterates over all candidates starting from `0` at each recursive call.
- Generates permutations and duplicate combinations (e.g., `[2, 2, 3]` and `[3, 2, 2]`).

**Efficient Loop:**
- Starts iteration from the current index `i`, ensuring non-decreasing order.
- Generates unique combinations without permutations (e.g., `[2, 2, 3]` and `[7]`).

**Summary of Loop Analysis in the Combination Sum Problem**

In the Combination Sum problem, we aim to find all unique combinations of candidate numbers that sum up to a target value. The critical difference between the two code implementations lies in how the for-loop iterates over the candidates during recursion.

### **Incorrect Loop (`for c in range(len(candidates))`):**

**Code Snippet:**

```python
# Incorrect loop starting from 0 every time
for c in range(len(candidates)):
    path.append(candidates[c])
    brute(c, target - candidates[c], path)
    path.pop()
```

**Analysis:**

- **Resets Index Each Time:** The loop starts from index `0` in every recursive call.
- **Generates Permutations:** By reconsidering all candidates at each level, it produces duplicate permutations of combinations (e.g., `[2, 3, 2]`, `[3, 2, 2]`).
- **Inefficient Recursion Tree:** Explores many redundant paths, leading to increased time complexity.
- **Time Complexity:** Exponential with a higher base due to duplicates. The upper bound is worse than the correct loop.
- **Requires Post-Processing:** Additional steps like sorting and deduplication (`res = list(set(res))`) are needed to eliminate duplicates, adding overhead.

---

### **Correct Loop (`for c in range(i, len(candidates))`):**

**Code Snippet:**

```python
# Correct loop starting from current index i
for c in range(i, len(candidates)):
    path.append(candidates[c])
    brute(c, target - candidates[c], path)
    path.pop()
```

**Analysis:**

- **Maintains Non-Decreasing Order:** The loop starts from the current index `i`, ensuring combinations are built without reordering elements.
- **Avoids Duplicates:** Generates each unique combination exactly once (e.g., only `[2, 2, 3]`).
- **Efficient Recursion Tree:** Explores only necessary paths, reducing redundant computations.
- **Time Complexity:** Still exponential but with a smaller base, leading to better performance.
- **No Post-Processing Needed:** Produces accurate results without extra steps for deduplication.

---

### **Comparative Highlights:**

- **Duplicate Combinations:**
  - **Incorrect Loop:** Produces duplicates due to permutations (e.g., `[2, 3, 2]` and `[3, 2, 2]`).
  - **Correct Loop:** Avoids duplicates by considering candidates in a fixed order.

- **Time Complexity:**
  - **Incorrect Loop:** Higher due to exploring all permutations.
  - **Correct Loop:** Lower because it prunes unnecessary branches.

- **Recursion Control:**
  - **Incorrect Loop:** Less disciplined, leading to a vast recursion tree.
  - **Correct Loop:** Controlled recursion with reduced depth and breadth.

- **Need for Extra Processing:**
  - **Incorrect Loop:** Requires additional sorting and deduplication.
  - **Correct Loop:** Outputs unique combinations naturally.

---

### **Conclusion:**

Starting the loop from the current index `i` in the correct loop is essential for efficiently solving the Combination Sum problem. It ensures that combinations are built in a non-decreasing order, preventing duplicates and reducing the time complexity. This approach leverages controlled recursion to explore valid combinations without redundant calculations, producing accurate results without the need for extra post-processing steps.
