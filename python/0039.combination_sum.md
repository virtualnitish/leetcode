# 39. Combination Sum

The backtracking code is mind-fuck! 

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates, target):
        def dfs(start, path, target):
            if target == 0:
                # If we've reached the target, add the current path to results
                result.append(list(path))
                return
            for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
                if candidates[i] > target:
                    # No need to continue if the candidate exceeds the target
                    break
                # Include the candidate and continue searching
                path.append(candidates[i])
                dfs(i, path, target - candidates[i])
                path.pop()
        
        candidates.sort()  # Sort candidates to improve efficiency
        result = []
        dfs(0, [], target)
        return result

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
candidates = [2, 3, 6, 7]
target = 7
print("Combinations:", solution.combinationSum(candidates, target))
# Output: [[2, 2, 3], [7]]
```

## Understanding the `path.pop()` Mystery

We have the example `[2, 3, 6, 7]`. When we call `dfs(i, path, target - candidates[i])`, it means we are including the candidate that `i` is pointing to. For simplicity, let's assume `i = 2`, which means it points to `6`. 
This means there will be a DFS run where `6` is part of the `path`, and we already do the `target - candidates[i]` when we initiate the DFS.

What you need to understand is that the DFS run above is **separate**! That run will execute independently, and we don't need to worry about it in the current context. 
After initiating this DFS that includes `6`, we proceed to **skip** the `6` in our current `path`. This is exactly what the code `path.pop()` is doing. We remove the `6` from `path`, adding or removing from the `path` does not affect the logic functionality in any way, `path` variable is just there to add accepted answer to result. 
After doing the `path.pop()`, the magic happens when we go back to the loop. The loop increments `i`, so now `i = 3`, which points towards `7`.

Since we removed the `6` from `path` previously, and we only *initiated* the DFS using `dfs(i, path, target - candidates[i])` when `6` was included, our original `target` remains unchanged in this context. Notice how we did not alter the `target` before â€” by doing `target - candidates[i]` while calling DFS, we just *initiated* a new DFS with a new `target` *if* `6` were included.

Now, the `path` may look like `[2, 3]` because we removed `6`. When we execute `path.append(candidates[i])`, we add `7`, making the `path` `[2, 3, 7]`. This `path` variable is basically used to build combinations to add into the result; it doesn't affect the actual function or logic of the algorithm. The **core** of the algorithm and code lies in the call `dfs(i, path, target - candidates[i])`, where we do not modify the original `target` variable but instead *initiate* a new instance of DFS with the adjusted `target` if we choose to include a candidate.


### Explanation of Approach:

1. **Sorting the Candidates**: We sort the candidates array to enhance efficiency. This allows us to stop further exploration as soon as we encounter a candidate that exceeds the current target.
2. **Base Case**: If the target becomes zero, we add the current path to the results as it represents a valid combination.
3. **Backtracking**: We add a candidate to the current path and recursively explore further by reducing the target. After exploring, we remove the last candidate (backtrack) and try the next candidate.

### Time & Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^T/M), where N is the number of candidates, T is the target value, and M is the minimum value in candidates. This represents the complexity of exploring all combinations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(T/M) for the recursion stack and storing the valid combinations.
