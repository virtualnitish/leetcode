# 213. House Robber II

```python
def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    if not nums:
        return 0
    n = len(nums)
    # When only one house is present.
    ## Because nums[1:] and nums[:-1] will send empty lists
    if n == 1:
        return nums[0]

    def robhouse(houses):
        rob1, rob2 = 0,0
        for n in houses:
            newrob = max(rob2, rob1+n)
            rob1 = rob2
            rob2 = newrob
        return rob2

    # Compare two scenarios: excluding first or last house
    return max(robhouse(nums[1:]), robhouse(nums[:-1]))

# Example usage:
houses = [2, 3, 2]
print(rob(houses))  # Output: 3
```

1. **Approach Explained:**

   Since the houses are arranged in a circle, robbing the first and last house together isn't allowed. To navigate this, we consider two separate cases:

   - **Case 1:** Rob houses from the first to the second-to-last (`nums[:-1]`).
   - **Case 2:** Rob houses from the second to the last (`nums[1:]`).

   For each case, we apply the standard House Robber dynamic programming approach, keeping track of the maximum amount robbed so far without alerting the police. Finally, we take the maximum of the two cases.

2. **Time & Space Complexity:**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(n), where *n* is the number of houses. We traverse the list twice, but linear time is maintained.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size.
