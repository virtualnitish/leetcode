# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

```python

class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        start, end = 0, 0
        
        for fixed in range(len(s)):
            for x in [0, 1]:  # Check for both even and odd length palindromes
                i, j = fixed - x, fixed + 1
                
                while i >= 0 and j < len(s) and s[i] == s[j]:
                    # Update the longest palindrome bounds if a longer one is found
                    if j - i > end - start:
                        start, end = i, j
                    i -= 1
                    j += 1
        
        # Return the longest palindromic substring
        return s[start:end + 1]
