# 768. Partition Lables

```python
def partitionLabels(S):
    # Dictionary to store the last occurrence of each character
    last_occurrence = {ch: i for i, ch in enumerate(S)}
    
    # Variables to track the end of the current partition and the start of the partition
    j, anchor = 0, 0
    result = []
    
    for i, ch in enumerate(S):
        # Update the end of the current partition
        j = max(j, last_occurrence[ch])
        
        # If we reach the end of the partition, add the length to the result
        if i == j:
            result.append(i - anchor + 1)
            anchor = i + 1
    
    return result

# Example usage:
S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
print(partitionLabels(S)) # Output: [9, 7, 8]
```

## Approach Explanation:
1. **Determine the Last Occurrence:**
   - First, traverse the string `S` and determine the last occurrence of each character. This will help us know the furthest point a character can be included in a partition.

2. **Create Partitions:**
   - Traverse the string again. Keep track of the maximum position (`j`) of the last occurrence of the characters seen so far.
   - If the current position (`i`) is the same as `j`, it means that the current partition can end here. Add the size of the partition to the result and start a new partition.

### Example with Iterations:
Let's use the example string "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij".

**Step 1: Determine the last occurrence of each character**
```
{'a': 8, 'b': 5, 'c': 7, 'd': 14, 'e': 15, 'f': 11, 'g': 13, 'h': 19, 'i': 22, 'j': 23, 'k': 20, 'l': 21}
```

**Step 2: Traverse the string and create partitions**
- Initialize `j = 0`, `anchor = 0`, and `result = []`.
- Iterate through each character in the string with index `i`:

1. `i = 0`, character = 'a':
   - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['a']) = 8`.
   - Current partition end: `j = 8`.

2. `i = 1`, character = 'b':
   - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['b']) = 8`.
   - Current partition end: `j = 8`.

3. `i = 2`, character = 'a':
   - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['a']) = 8`.
   - Current partition end: `j = 8`.

4. `i = 3`, character = 'b':
   - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['b']) = 8`.
   - Current partition end: `j = 8`.

5. `i = 4`, character = 'c':
   - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['c']) = 8`.
   - Current partition end: `j = 8`.

6. `i = 5`, character = 'b':
   - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['b']) = 8`.
   - Current partition end: `j = 8`.

7. `i = 6`, character = 'a':
   - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['a']) = 8`.
   - Current partition end: `j = 8`.

8. `i = 7`, character = 'c':
   - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['c']) = 8`.
   - Current partition end: `j = 8`.

9. `i = 8`, character = 'a':
   - `i == j`, end of partition. Add partition size `9` to `result`.
   - `result = [9]`.
   - Update `anchor = 9`.

10. `i = 9`, character = 'd':
    - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['d']) = 14`.
    - Current partition end: `j = 14`.

11. `i = 10`, character = 'e':
    - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['e']) = 15`.
    - Current partition end: `j = 15`.

12. `i = 11`, character = 'f':
    - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['f']) = 15`.
    - Current partition end: `j = 15`.

13. `i = 12`, character = 'e':
    - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['e']) = 15`.
    - Current partition end: `j = 15`.

14. `i = 13`, character = 'g':
    - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['g']) = 15`.
    - Current partition end: `j = 15`.

15. `i = 14`, character = 'd':
    - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['d']) = 15`.
    - Current partition end: `j = 15`.

16. `i = 15`, character = 'e':
    - `i == j`, end of partition. Add partition size `7` to `result`.
    - `result = [9, 7]`.
    - Update `anchor = 16`.

17. `i = 16`, character = 'h':
    - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['h']) = 19`.
    - Current partition end: `j = 19`.

18. `i = 17`, character = 'i':
    - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['i']) = 22`.
    - Current partition end: `j = 22`.

19. `i = 18`, character = 'j':
    - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['j']) = 23`.
    - Current partition end: `j = 23`.

20. `i = 19`, character = 'h':
    - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['h']) = 23`.
    - Current partition end: `j = 23`.

21. `i = 20`, character = 'k':
    - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['k']) = 23`.
    - Current partition end: `j = 23`.

22. `i = 21`, character = 'l':
    - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['l']) = 23`.
    - Current partition end: `j = 23`.

23. `i = 22`, character = 'i':
    - Update `j = max(j, last_occurrence['i']) = 23`.
    - Current partition end: `j = 23`.

24. `i = 23`, character = 'j':
    - `i == j`, end of partition. Add partition size `8` to `result`.
    - `result = [9, 7, 8]`.
    - Update `anchor = 24`.

### Final Output:
- The partitions are [9, 7, 8], meaning the string can be partitioned into parts with lengths 9, 7, and 8 respectively.

### Recap:
1. Identify the last occurrence of each character.
2. Traverse the string and create partitions based on the last occurrence of the characters.
3. Add the partition size to the result when the end of the partition is reached.
