class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # Initialize adjacency list for each course
        preMap = {i: [] for i in range(numCourses)}

        # Populate adjacency list with prerequisites
        for course, pre in prerequisites:

        # Set to track nodes in the current path for cycle detection

            # If the course has no prerequisites left, it's already processed
            if preMap[course] == []:
                return True

            # Mark the course as visiting
            visiting.add(course)
            # Recursively visit all prerequisites
            for pre in preMap[course]:
                if not dfs(pre):
                    return False
            # Unmark the course from the current path
            visiting.remove(course)
            # Mark the course as processed by emptying its prerequisites
            preMap[course] = []
            return True

        # Perform DFS for each course
        for c in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(c):

        return True  # No cycles detected, all courses can be finished
```

**Time Complexity:** O(V + E)

**Space Complexity:** O(V + E)


### Key Points:
1. **Adjacency List Initialization**:
   - `preMap`: Maps each course to a list of its prerequisites.

2. **Populate Adjacency List**:
   - For each pair `[course, pre]` in prerequisites, append `pre` to the list of `course`'s prerequisites in `preMap`.

3. **Cycle Detection Using DFS**:
   - `visiting`: Set to track nodes currently in the DFS path to detect cycles.
   - `dfs(course)`: Recursive function to visit each course and its prerequisites:
     - If `course` is already in `visiting`, a cycle is detected.
     - If `course` has no prerequisites left, it is already processed.
     - Recursively visit each prerequisite `pre` of `course`.
     - After visiting, remove `course` from `visiting` and mark it as processed by emptying its prerequisites.

4. **Perform DFS for Each Course**:
   - Iterate over each course and perform DFS.
   - If any course returns `False` (cycle detected), return `False`.
   - If all courses are processed without detecting a cycle, return `True`.


### Time Complexity:
- **Building the Adjacency List**:
  - This step takes `O(E)` time, where `E` is the number of prerequisite pairs (edges).

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
  - In the worst case, we visit each node and edge exactly once. Therefore, the DFS traversal takes `O(V + E)` time, where `V` is the number of courses (nodes) and `E` is the number of edges.

- **Overall**:
  - Combining the steps, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(V + E)`.

### Space Complexity:
- **Adjacency List**:
  - The adjacency list `preMap` uses `O(V + E)` space to store all the nodes and edges.

- **Visiting Set**:
  - The `visiting` set keeps track of nodes in the current path. In the worst case, it can contain up to `O(V)` nodes.

- **Call Stack**:
  - The recursion stack in DFS can go up to `O(V)` depth in the worst case.

- **Overall**:
  - Combining these, the overall space complexity is `O(V + E)`.

### Summary:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`


# Doubts

## Why remove (`visiting.remove(course)`) once DFS is done with its prerequisites?

Removing the course from the `visiting` set is a crucial step to ensure the accuracy of our Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for cycle detection.

Here’s why it’s necessary:
1. **Cycle Detection:** The `visiting` set keeps track of the nodes (courses) currently being visited in the current DFS path. If we encounter a node already in this set, it indicates a cycle because we have encountered the same node before completing the DFS for it. 
2. **Backtracking:** Once we finish processing a node (i.e., all its prerequisites have been visited and no cycle is detected), we backtrack by removing the node from the `visiting` set. This step ensures that the current path no longer considers this node, preventing incorrect cycle detection in future DFS calls. 

**Illustrative Example:**
Consider a scenario with 4 courses and the following prerequisites:
```
0 -> 1
1 -> 2
2 -> 0 (cycle)
3 -> 2
```
- Start with `dfs(0)`. Add 0 to `visiting`. Call `dfs(1)` next.
- Add 1 to `visiting`. Call `dfs(2)` next.
- Add 2 to `visiting`. Call `dfs(0)` next.
- 0 is already in `visiting`. **Cycle Detected!** Return `False`.

Without `visiting.remove(course)` during backtracking:
- Suppose we didn’t remove nodes from the `visiting` set upon finishing DFS for them.
- When starting `dfs(3)`, it calls `dfs(2)`:
  - Since 2 remains in the `visiting` set (from previous DFS path), it falsely indicates a cycle, even though no new cycle is present for course 3. This incorrect detection would cause the algorithm to return `False` inappropriately.

To sum up, removing the course from `visiting` upon backtracking ensures that only the current DFS path is considered, leading to correct cycle detection and accurate results.
