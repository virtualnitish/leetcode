# 207. Course Schedule

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # Initialize adjacency list for each course
        preMap = {i: [] for i in range(numCourses)}

        # Populate adjacency list with prerequisites
        for course, pre in prerequisites:
            preMap[course].append(pre)

        # Set to track nodes in the current path for cycle detection
        visiting = set()

        def dfs(course):
            # If the course is in the current path, a cycle is detected
            if course in visiting:
                return False
            # If the course has no prerequisites left, it's already processed
            if preMap[course] == []:
                return True

            # Mark the course as visiting
            visiting.add(course)
            # Recursively visit all prerequisites
            for pre in preMap[course]:
                if not dfs(pre):
                    return False
            # Unmark the course from the current path
            visiting.remove(course)
            # Mark the course as processed by emptying its prerequisites
            preMap[course] = []
            return True

        # Perform DFS for each course
        for c in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(c):
                return False  # Cycle detected, courses can't be finished
        return True  # No cycles detected, all courses can be finished

**Time Complexity:** O(V + E)

**Space Complexity:** O(V + E)


### Key Points:
1. **Adjacency List Initialization**:
   - `preMap`: Maps each course to a list of its prerequisites.

2. **Populate Adjacency List**:
   - For each pair `[course, pre]` in prerequisites, append `pre` to the list of `course`'s prerequisites in `preMap`.

3. **Cycle Detection Using DFS**:
   - `visiting`: Set to track nodes currently in the DFS path to detect cycles.
   - `dfs(course)`: Recursive function to visit each course and its prerequisites:
     - If `course` is already in `visiting`, a cycle is detected.
     - If `course` has no prerequisites left, it is already processed.
     - Recursively visit each prerequisite `pre` of `course`.
     - After visiting, remove `course` from `visiting` and mark it as processed by emptying its prerequisites.

4. **Perform DFS for Each Course**:
   - Iterate over each course and perform DFS.
   - If any course returns `False` (cycle detected), return `False`.
   - If all courses are processed without detecting a cycle, return `True`.


### Time Complexity:
- **Building the Adjacency List**:
  - This step takes `O(E)` time, where `E` is the number of prerequisite pairs (edges).

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
  - In the worst case, we visit each node and edge exactly once. Therefore, the DFS traversal takes `O(V + E)` time, where `V` is the number of courses (nodes) and `E` is the number of edges.

- **Overall**:
  - Combining the steps, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(V + E)`.

### Space Complexity:
- **Adjacency List**:
  - The adjacency list `preMap` uses `O(V + E)` space to store all the nodes and edges.

- **Visiting Set**:
  - The `visiting` set keeps track of nodes in the current path. In the worst case, it can contain up to `O(V)` nodes.

- **Call Stack**:
  - The recursion stack in DFS can go up to `O(V)` depth in the worst case.

- **Overall**:
  - Combining these, the overall space complexity is `O(V + E)`.

### Summary:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`

This means the algorithm is efficient in terms of both time and space, making it suitable for large input sizes typically encountered in such problems. Let me know if you need further clarifications or have any more questions!
