# 322. Coin Change

```python
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    # Initialize a list to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount
    ## We can also use `amount+1` instead of `float('inf')`.
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 amount requires 0 coins

    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)

    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1

# Example usage
coins = [1, 2, 5]
amount = 11
print(coinChange(coins, amount))  # Output: 3
```

### Approach and Trick

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We use a DP array to store the minimum number of coins needed to make each amount from `0` to `amount`.
2. **Initialization**: We initialize the DP array with infinity (`float('inf')`), except for `dp[0]` which is set to `0` because zero amount requires zero coins.
3. **Iterative Update**: For each coin, we update the DP array for all amounts that are greater than or equal to the coin's value by taking the minimum number of coins required.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the number of coins and `m` is the amount. This is because for each coin, we iterate through all amounts from the coin's value to the target amount.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m)`, where `m` is the amount. This is due to the DP array which stores the minimum number of coins needed for each amount up to `amount`.


### Approach Explanation
The solution uses Dynamic Programming (DP) to find the minimum number of coins needed to make up a given amount.

1. **DP Initialization**:
   - We create a list `dp` with `amount + 1` elements, initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`), to represent the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from `0` to `amount`.
   - We set `dp[0] = 0` because zero amount requires zero coins.

2. **Iterative Updates**:
   - For each coin in the `coins` list, we iterate through amounts from the coin's value to the target amount.
   - For each amount `i`, we update `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - coin] + 1`. This update ensures that we consider the case of using the current coin to form the amount `i`.

### Visualization with Example
Let's visualize this with an example:

#### Example
**Coins**: [1, 2, 5]  
**Amount**: 11

**Steps**:
1. **Initialization**: `dp = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf]`
2. **Processing Coin 1**:
   - For `i` from 1 to 11, update `dp[i]` using coin 1.
   - `dp = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`

3. **Processing Coin 2**:
   - For `i` from 2 to 11, update `dp[i]` using coin 2.
   - `dp = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6]`

4. **Processing Coin 5**:
   - For `i` from 5 to 11, update `dp[i]` using coin 5.
   - `dp = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3]`

The minimum number of coins to make the amount 11 is `dp[11] = 3` (using coins 5, 5, and 1).
