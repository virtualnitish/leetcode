# 49. Group Anagrams

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        anagrams = {}
        
        for word in strs:
            # Sort the word and use it as a key
            sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
            if sorted_word in anagrams:
                anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)
            else:
                anagrams[sorted_word] = [word]
        
        return list(anagrams.values())
```

**Anagrams** are words or phrases made by rearranging the letters of 
another word or phrase using all original letters exactly once. 
For example, "listen" and "silent" are anagrams. The frequency of characters
must also match.

The logic is to sort the words and use them as the key for the dict.
This way all the words with same characters with same frequency will be 
part of the same key. 


**Time Complexity:** O(NKlog⁡K), where N is the number of words and K is the maximum length of a word. Sorting each word takes O(Klog⁡K), and we do this for each of the N words.

**Space Complexity:** O(NK), where N is the number of words and K is the maximum length of a word. We store all words and their grouped anagrams.
