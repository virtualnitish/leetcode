# 1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points

The question just gave us "points". The possible path for these points can 
be anything from every other point. Hence, while building the `adj_list` from
the coordinates we are connecting each node with every other node. 

This solution uses Prim's Algorithm which find the minimum spanning tree cost.

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostConnectPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        N = len(points)
        adj = {i: [] for i in range(N)}  # i : list of [cost, node]
        for i in range(N):
            x1, y1 = points[i]
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                x2, y2 = points[j]
                dist = abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)
                adj[i].append([dist, j])
                adj[j].append([dist, i])

        # Prim's
        res = 0
        visit = set()
        minH = [[0, 0]]  # [cost, point]
        while len(visit) < N:
            cost, i = heapq.heappop(minH)
            if i in visit:
                continue
            res += cost
            visit.add(i)
            for neiCost, nei in adj[i]:
                if nei not in visit:
                    heapq.heappush(minH, [neiCost, nei])
        return res
```        


Why `while len(visit) < N` is there in Prim's Algorithm, 
instead of `len(visit) <= N`?    

Becauses, the loop terminates when `len(visited) == N`,i.e. when all the nodes are 
*visited* the graph.
