# 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

```python
class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, k: int) -> int:
        dist = [float("inf")] * n
        # starting from src
        dist[src] = 0
        tmp = []
        # Only k stops are allowed
        for _ in range(k+1):
            ## Same edges should not be relaxed multiple times
            ## with each relaxation we add a new node
            ## hence only k times we'll relax 
            tmp = dist.copy()
            for u,v,w in flights:
                ## Find the min value for current iteration
                ## tmp[v] is compared with previous iter's dist[u]
                if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + w < tmp[v]:
                    ## To make sure to use last iteration's distance
                    ## dist[u] is used
                    tmp[v] = dist[u] + w
            dist = tmp.copy()
        return dist[dst] if dist[dst] != float('inf') else -1
```

**Time Complexity:** O(kE) where k is number of stops and E is the number of
                     flights.   
**Space Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of distinct source/destinations.  


The code is a modified version of Bellman-Ford's algorithm.   


Why `k+1` in `for _ in range(k+1)`?   
Because between `k` stops there are `k+1` edges and they all need to be *relaxed*.

In the example below, 3 stops between *Source* and *Destination* have 4 edges.

```
                                                              
                                                              
  [Source]───► Stop1───► Stop2────► Stop3────► [DESTINATION]   
                                                              
                                                              
```

## Same but detailed solution

```python
class Solution:
   def findCheapestPrice(
      self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, k: int
   ) -> int:
      # Initialize prices to reach each node as infinity
      prices = [float("inf")] * n
      # The price to reach the source node is 0
      prices[src] = 0

      # Iterate up to k+1 times (k stops means k+1 edges)
      for i in range(k + 1):
         # Create a temporary copy of prices to store updates for this iteration
         tmpPrices = prices.copy()

         # Iterate over all flights
         for s, d, p in flights:  # s=source, d=dest, p=price
            # If the source node has not been reached yet, skip this flight
            if prices[s] == float("inf"):
               continue
            # If a cheaper price to reach destination d is found, update tmpPrices
            if prices[s] + p < tmpPrices[d]:
               tmpPrices[d] = prices[s] + p
         # Update prices with the new values from tmpPrices
         prices = tmpPrices

      # If the destination node is still infinity, return -1 (no such route)
      return -1 if prices[dst] == float("inf") else prices[dst]
```


The solution uses a bit modified version of Bellman-Ford Algorithm

### Why Use `tmpPrices`:
1. **Limited Iterations (`k+1` Iterations)**:
   - The problem requires finding the cheapest flight price with at most `k` stops, meaning we should only consider up to `k+1` edge relaxations (where `k+1` includes the initial source node).

2. **Preventing Premature Updates**:
   - In the given problem, each iteration represents considering flights with a certain number of stops. By using a temporary list `tmpPrices`, the algorithm ensures that all flights in the current iteration are processed based on the prices from the previous iteration, not affecting each other within the same iteration.
   - This distinction ensures that flights considered in the current iteration do not influence others in the same iteration cycle, which might otherwise lead to incorrect results.

### Difference from Original Bellman-Ford:
- **Original Bellman-Ford**: In the traditional Bellman-Ford algorithm, all vertices are processed for `V-1` iterations (where `V` is the number of vertices), allowing all shortest paths to converge. Since each vertex update is propagated in sequence, there's no need for a temporary list as all edges are relaxed multiple times, ensuring convergence.
- **Modified for K Stops**: The modified version considers flights with at most `k` stops. To ensure flights from the current iteration (number of stops) do not influence others prematurely, a temporary list `tmpPrices` is used to store updated prices for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `prices[src] = 0`: Sets the price to reach the source vertex to `0`.
   - `prices = [float("inf")] * n`: Initializes prices to reach all other vertices as infinity.

2. **Iterate `k+1` times**:
   - Outer loop: Iterates up to `k+1` times to relax edges for up to `k` stops.
   - `tmpPrices = prices.copy()`: Creates a copy of the current prices to ensure updates within the current iteration do not affect other flights in the same iteration.

3. **Relaxation**:
   - Inner loop: Iterates over all flights (edges) and updates the `tmpPrices` list if a cheaper price is found via the current flight.
   - `if prices[s] + p < tmpPrices[d]`: Updates the price to reach destination `d` if a cheaper price is found through source `s`.

4. **Update Prices**:
   - `prices = tmpPrices`: After processing all flights for the current iteration, updates the `prices` list with the new prices for the next iteration.

5. **Result**:
   - `return -1 if prices[dst] == float("inf") else prices[dst]`: Returns the final cheapest price to reach the destination within `k` stops or `-1` if no such price exists.

By using `tmpPrices`, the algorithm ensures that the current iteration's updates are only applied after all flights have been considered, preserving the integrity of the constraints (`k` stops).

Absolutely! Here’s a clean set of notes you can keep for quick reference, focused on understanding why we use `tmp` in the context of the Leetcode 787 problem, along with a brief refresher on the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

# 🧭 Bellman-Ford Refresher

**Purpose:**  
Find the shortest path from a source to all vertices in a weighted graph, even with negative weights.

**Core Steps:**
1. Initialize `dist[src] = 0`, and all others to `∞`.
2. Repeat `n − 1` times: for each edge `(u → v, weight w)`, update:
   ```
   if dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
       dist[v] = dist[u] + w
   ```
3. (Optional) Do one extra pass to detect negative cycles: if any distance still improves, there's a cycle.

✅ **Updates happen in-place**, which is fine when edge count isn’t constrained.

# 🛬 Why Do We Use `tmp` in Leetcode 787 (with ≤ K Stops)?

In 787, we **limit the number of edges used to at most `K + 1`**, which is very different from classic Bellman-Ford.

To achieve this:
- You run the relaxation loop `K + 1` times.
- But critically: **each pass may only consider one more edge than the previous**.
- That means you must **avoid using updated distances from the same iteration** — or you might chain multiple edges in a single pass.

✅ Solution: **Use a snapshot `tmp = dist.copy()` at the beginning of each iteration.**

---

# 🧪 The Critical Example: What Goes Wrong Without `tmp`

### Graph:

```
0 → 1 (cost 1)
1 → 2 (cost 2)
2 → 3 (cost 3)
```

### Settings:
- `src = 0`, `dst = 3`, `K = 1` (so only 2 edges max allowed)

---

## ❌ Case A: In-place updates (Incorrect)

**Iteration 0:**
- `dist[1]` = 0 + 1 = 1
- `dist[2]` = 1 + 2 = 3  ← uses the new `dist[1]` from this same pass
- `dist[3]` = 3 + 3 = 6  ← again, using freshly updated `dist[2]`

Now you’ve used **three edges** in one pass — which violates the `K` constraint. This result is invalid.

---

## ✅ Case B: With `tmp = dist.copy()` (Correct)

Each iteration uses the **snapshot from the previous round**:

**Iteration 0 (paths with ≤1 edge):**
- Relax 0→1 using `dist[0]` → `tmp[1] = 1`
- Skips 1→2, 2→3 (since `dist[1]`, `dist[2]` still ∞)

**Iteration 1 (paths with ≤2 edges):**
- Relax 1→2 using `dist[1] = 1` → `tmp[2] = 3`
- Skips 2→3 (still `dist[2] = ∞`)

Result: `dist[3] = ∞` → no valid path within 2 edges → correct return `-1`.

---

# 🧩 Takeaway

- Bellman-Ford doesn’t constrain the number of edges used per iteration — fine for general shortest paths.
- Leetcode 787 **must** control the edge count per iteration.
- So we **must isolate each round’s progress using `tmp`**, ensuring only one edge per layer.

🔁 Think of it like layers:
- Layer 0: 0 edges
- Layer 1: 1 edge
- ...
- Layer K+1: up to `K+1` edges

Each layer builds only from the one beneath it, not from itself.
