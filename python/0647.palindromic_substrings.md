# 647. Palindromic Substrings

```python
def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
    count = 0
    for fixed in range(len(s)):
        for x in [0, 1]:
            i, j = fixed, fixed + x
            while i >= 0 and j < len(s) and s[i] == s[j]:
                count += 1
                i -= 1
                j += 1
    return count
```

The `i, j = fixed, fixed + x` initialize to the same index when `x=0`,
which covers the sigle alphabet being treated as a palindrome and also 
expands to find the even length palindromes.

**Time Complexity:** `(n^2)`
