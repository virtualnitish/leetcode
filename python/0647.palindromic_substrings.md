# 647. Palindromic Substrings

The question is an extension to the [5. Longest Palindromic Substring](0005.longest_palindrome_substring.md) problem.   

```python
def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
    count = 0
    for fixed in range(len(s)):
        for x in [0, 1]:
            i, j = fixed, fixed + x
            while i >= 0 and j < len(s) and s[i] == s[j]:
                count += 1
                i -= 1
                j += 1
    return count
```

The initialization `i, j = fixed, fixed + x` ensures that when `x = 0`, both pointers start at the same index. This correctly counts single-character palindromes and also allows expansion to find even-length palindromes.

Therefore, it is important to use only `i, j = fixed, fixed + x`. If we use `i, j = fixed - x, fixed + 1` as in the [5. Longest Palindromic Substring](0005.longest_palindrome_substring.md) problem, the code will miss single-character palindromes

**Time Complexity:** O(n<sup>2</sup>)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
