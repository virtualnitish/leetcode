# 253. Meeting Rooms II

```python
def minMeetingRooms(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return 0

    # Sort intervals based on start times
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Initialize a min-heap to track end times of meetings
    import heapq
    end_times = []

    for interval in intervals:
        # If the room is free (earliest ending meeting is done), remove it from the heap
        if end_times and interval[0] >= end_times[0]:
            heapq.heappop(end_times)
        # Allocate the current meeting room (add its end time to the heap)
        heapq.heappush(end_times, interval[1])

    # The size of the heap tells us the minimum rooms required
    return len(end_times)

# Example usage:
meetings = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
print(minMeetingRooms(meetings))  # Output: 2
```

**1. Explanation of the approach:**

The key to solving this problem efficiently is using a **min-heap (priority queue)** to keep track of the end times of meetings currently occupying rooms. Here's how the algorithm works:

- **Sort the meetings** by their start times to process them in chronological order.
- **Initialize a min-heap** (`end_times`) to keep track of meeting end times. This heap will always have the earliest ending meeting at the top.
- **Iterate through each meeting:**
  - **Free up rooms:** If the earliest ending meeting ends before the current meeting starts (`interval[0] >= end_times[0]`), remove it from the heap using `heapq.heappop(end_times)`. This represents freeing up a room.
  - **Allocate a room:** Add the current meeting's end time to the heap with `heapq.heappush(end_times, interval[1])`, representing booking a room.
- **Result:** The maximum size of the `end_times` heap during iteration represents the minimum number of rooms required to accommodate all meetings.

**Why a min-heap?** Using a min-heap for end times allows us to efficiently find the earliest meeting that ends to decide whether a room frees up before the next meeting starts, optimizing room utilization.

**2. Time & Space Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
  - **Sorting:** The intervals are sorted by start times, which takes O(n log n).
  - **Heap Operations:** Each meeting is added to and possibly removed from the heap. Since heap insertions and deletions take O(log n), and we have n meetings, this results in O(n log n) time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - In the worst-case scenario, where all meetings overlap, the heap will contain all n meeting end times.

**Further Insights:**

- **Understanding the Heap Approach:**

  This method efficiently manages room allocation by always knowing which meeting ends the soonest. It's a classic example of using a priority queue to optimize scheduling problems.

- **Alternative Method â€“ Chronological Ordering:**

  Another approach involves separating start and end times:

  ```python
  def minMeetingRooms(intervals):
      starts = sorted([i[0] for i in intervals])
      ends = sorted([i[1] for i in intervals])
      
      s, e = 0, 0
      used_rooms = 0
      
      while s < len(intervals):
          if starts[s] >= ends[e]:
              used_rooms -= 1
              e += 1
          used_rooms += 1
          s += 1
          
      return used_rooms
  ```

  **Explanation:**

  - **Sort start and end times separately.**
  - **Use two pointers** to traverse the starts and ends:
    - If the next meeting starts after the earliest ending meeting, a room frees up.
    - Otherwise, we need an additional room.
  - **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to sorting.

- **Real-World Connection:**

  Imagine you're managing conference rooms in an office. Each time a meeting ends, you check if a room becomes available for the next meeting. This algorithm mimics that process, ensuring minimal resources are used efficiently.

- **Extending Your Skills:**

  Dive deeper into how **heap data structures** optimize algorithms. Understanding heaps is crucial for efficient scheduling, priority queues, and graph algorithms like Dijkstra's.
