# 198. House Robber

### Easier to understand variables

```python
def rob(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    # Maximum loot value until house 1 and house 2
    rob1, rob2 = 0, 0
    for n in nums:
        ## Calculate the new maximum by deciding to rob or skip the current house
        ## You can select house 1 + house 3 or select only house 2
        newRob = max(rob1 + n, rob2)
        ## Move the variables by one step forward
        ## rob2, rob1, newRob -> previousRob2, rob2, rob1
        ### In the next loop we will calculate the newRob
        rob1 = rob2
        rob2 = newRob
    return rob2

# Example usage
houses = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]
print(rob(houses))  # Output: 12
```

### Solution

```python
def rob(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    prev_max = curr_max = 0
    for num in nums:
        # Calculate the new maximum by deciding to rob or skip the current house
        temp = curr_max
        curr_max = max(prev_max + num, curr_max)
        prev_max = temp

    return curr_max

# Example usage
houses = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]
print(rob(houses))  # Output: 12
```

Understand that the `prev_max` here is **not** the previous house value. 
`prev_max` here indicates the maximum value robbers have robbed until 
**previous-to-previous** house irrespective of wheather the 
*previous-to-previous house* was robbed or skipped.   
`prev_max + num` means that we sum the maximum value until the
*previous-to-previous* house and *current* house, or skip this house and 
keep the `current`, which is the maximum value until the *previous* house.


### Approach

**Dynamic Programming with Space Optimization**:

- **Idea**: At each house, decide whether to rob it (and add its value to the total from two houses back) or skip it (and carry forward the total from the previous house).
- **Implementation**:
  - Initialize two variables:
    - `prev_max`: Maximum amount that can be robbed up to the previous house.
    - `curr_max`: Maximum amount that can be robbed up to the current house.
  - Iterate through the list of house values (`nums`):
    - For each house, update `curr_max` to be the maximum of:
      - `prev_max + num` (robbing the current house).
      - `curr_max` (skipping the current house).
    - Update `prev_max` to the value of `temp` (which holds the old `curr_max`).

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of houses.
  - We traverse the list of houses once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, constant space.
  - Only a fixed number of variables are used, regardless of the input size.

## Deep Dive into the DP Process

Let's dive into the **House Robber** problem using a DP array instead of **two variable** method to capture the maximum robbed value at each step.

```python
def rob(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    n = len(nums)
    # Initialize DP array where dp[i] represents the maximum amount that can be robbed up to house i
    dp = [0] * n

    # Base cases
    dp[0] = nums[0]  # Only one house to rob
    if n > 1:
        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])  # Choose the maximum of the first two houses

    # Build the DP array
    for i in range(2, n):
        # At each house, decide to rob it (dp[i-2] + nums[i]) or skip it (dp[i-1])
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i])

    return dp[-1]  # The last element contains the maximum amount that can be robbed

# Example usage
houses = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]
print(rob(houses))  # Output: 12
```

### Step-by-Step Visualization of the DP Array

Let's break down how the DP array is constructed with the example `houses = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]`.

#### **Initialization:**

- **Input Houses:** `[2, 7, 9, 3, 1]`
- **DP Array:** Initialize `dp` with zeros.
  ```
  dp = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ```

#### **Base Cases:**

1. **First House (Index 0):**
   - Only one option: rob it.
   - `dp[0] = nums[0] = 2`
   ```
   dp = [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ```
2. **Second House (Index 1):**
   - Options:
     - Rob it: `nums[1] = 7`
     - Skip it: `dp[0] = 2`
   - Choose the maximum:
     - `dp[1] = max(nums[1], dp[0]) = max(7, 2) = 7`
   ```
   dp = [2, 7, 0, 0, 0]
   ```

#### **Iterative Updates:**

Now, we iterate from the third house to the end.

3. **Third House (Index 2):**
   - Options:
     - Rob it: `dp[0] + nums[2] = 2 + 9 = 11`
     - Skip it: `dp[1] = 7`
   - Choose the maximum:
     - `dp[2] = max(dp[1], dp[0] + nums[2]) = max(7, 11) = 11`
   ```
   dp = [2, 7, 11, 0, 0]
   ```
4. **Fourth House (Index 3):**
   - Options:
     - Rob it: `dp[1] + nums[3] = 7 + 3 = 10`
     - Skip it: `dp[2] = 11`
   - Choose the maximum:
     - `dp[3] = max(dp[2], dp[1] + nums[3]) = max(11, 10) = 11`
   ```
   dp = [2, 7, 11, 11, 0]
   ```
5. **Fifth House (Index 4):**
   - Options:
     - Rob it: `dp[2] + nums[4] = 11 + 1 = 12`
     - Skip it: `dp[3] = 11`
   - Choose the maximum:
     - `dp[4] = max(dp[3], dp[2] + nums[4]) = max(11, 12) = 12`
   ```
   dp = [2, 7, 11, 11, 12]
   ```

#### **Final DP Array:**

- The DP array after processing all houses:
  ```
  dp = [2, 7, 11, 11, 12]
  ```
- **Maximum amount that can be robbed:** `dp[-1] = 12`

### Explanation of the DP Relation

At each house `i`, the DP relation is:

- `dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i])`

This means:

- **Skip the current house:** Keep the maximum amount up to the previous house (`dp[i - 1]`).
- **Rob the current house:** Add the current house's money to the amount from two houses back (`dp[i - 2] + nums[i]`).

We choose the option that yields the higher amount.

### Visualizing the Decision at Each Step

Let's tabulate the choices:

| House Index (i) | House Value (`nums[i]`) | Rob (`dp[i - 2] + nums[i]`) | Skip (`dp[i - 1]`) | Chosen Max (`dp[i]`) |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
|       0         |           2             |           N/A               |        N/A         |          2           |
|       1         |           7             |           7                 |         2          |          7           |
|       2         |           9             |         2 + 9 = 11          |         7          |         11           |
|       3         |           3             |         7 + 3 = 10          |        11          |         11           |
|       4         |           1             |        11 + 1 = 12          |        11          |         12           |

**Decisions:**

- **House 0:** Only option is to rob (`dp[0] = 2`).
- **House 1:** Choose between robbing (`7`) or previous max (`2`).
- **House 2:** Choose between robbing (`11`) or previous max (`7`).
- **House 3:** Choose between robbing (`10`) or previous max (`11`).
- **House 4:** Choose between robbing (`12`) or previous max (`11`).

### Key Takeaways

- **DP Array Stores:** The maximum amount that can be robbed up to each house.
- **Decision Making:** At each step, we make a strategic choice to maximize the total amount without alerting the police (i.e., not robbing two adjacent houses).
- **DP Relation Importance:** Understanding the DP relation helps in formulating solutions for similar problems.

### Applying This Approach Broadly

Grasping this DP array method enhances your ability to tackle other dynamic programming problems, especially those involving sequential decisions, such as:

- **"Climbing Stairs":** Calculating ways to reach the top by taking 1 or 2 steps.
- **"Maximum Subarray":** Finding the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum.
- **"Delete and Earn":** Similar to House Robber but with a twist on the values.

## Transition from DP Array Solution to a Two Variables Solution

The key insight is that in the DP array solution, to compute the maximum amount that can be robbed up to house `i`, we only need the values from the previous two houses (`dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`). This limited dependency allows us to replace the DP array with two variables, thereby optimizing space from \(O(n)\) to \(O(1)\).

---

### **Step-by-Step Transition Guide**

#### **1. Understand the DP Array Solution**

In the array-based approach, we use a DP array `dp[]` where:

- **dp[i]** represents the maximum amount that can be robbed up to house **i**.
- The recurrence relation is:

  \[
  dp[i] = \max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i])
  \]

#### **2. Identify the Dependency**

- **Current State Depends On:**
  - **dp[i - 1]**: Maximum amount without robbing the current house.
  - **dp[i - 2] + nums[i]**: Maximum amount by robbing the current house (can't rob the previous one).

#### **3. Recognize that Only Two Values are Needed**

- At any point, we only need to keep track of the **last two DP values**.
- **Eliminate the DP array** by using two variables to store these values.

#### **4. Initialize Two Variables**

- **prev1** (equivalent to **dp[i - 1]**): Maximum amount up to the previous house.
- **prev2** (equivalent to **dp[i - 2]**): Maximum amount up to the house before the previous one.

Initialize:

- **prev1 = max(nums[0], nums[1])** (for **i = 1**)
- **prev2 = nums[0]**

#### **5. Iterate Using the Two Variables**

For **i** from **2** to **n - 1**:

1. **Calculate the Current Maximum**:

   \[
   curr = \max(prev1, prev2 + nums[i])
   \]

2. **Update the Variables**:

   - **prev2 = prev1**
   - **prev1 = curr**

#### **6. Return the Final Result**

- The variable **prev1** holds the maximum amount that can be robbed.

---

### **Code Implementation**

```python
def rob(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    n = len(nums)
    if n == 1:
        return nums[0]

    # Initialize the two variables
    prev2 = nums[0]
    prev1 = max(nums[0], nums[1])

    # Iterate through the houses
    for i in range(2, n):
        curr = max(prev1, prev2 + nums[i])
        prev2 = prev1
        prev1 = curr

    return prev1

# Example usage
houses = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]
print(rob(houses))  # Output: 12
```

---

### **Detailed Example with Visualization**

Let's walk through the example **houses = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]** step by step.

#### **Initialization**

- **prev2 = nums[0] = 2**
- **prev1 = max(nums[0], nums[1]) = max(2, 7) = 7**

#### **Iteration Steps**

| House Index (**i**) | **nums[i]** | **Calculation**                          | **curr** | **prev2** (dp[i - 2]) | **prev1** (dp[i - 1]) |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------|------------------------|
|          2          |      9      | curr = max(prev1, prev2 + nums[i])       | curr = max(7, 2 + 9) = **11** | prev2 = 7              | prev1 = 11             |
|          3          |      3      | curr = max(prev1, prev2 + nums[i])       | curr = max(11, 7 + 3) = **11** | prev2 = 11             | prev1 = 11             |
|          4          |      1      | curr = max(prev1, prev2 + nums[i])       | curr = max(11, 11 + 1) = **12** | prev2 = 11             | prev1 = 12             |

#### **Explanation of Each Step**

1. **At House 2 (Index 2):**
   - **Option 1 (Skip):** Keep the previous max amount `prev1 = 7`.
   - **Option 2 (Rob):** Add current house to `prev2`: `prev2 + nums[2] = 2 + 9 = 11`.
   - **Choose Maximum:** `curr = max(7, 11) = 11`.
   - **Update Variables:** `prev2 = 7`, `prev1 = 11`.

2. **At House 3 (Index 3):**
   - **Option 1 (Skip):** `prev1 = 11`.
   - **Option 2 (Rob):** `prev2 + nums[3] = 7 + 3 = 10`.
   - **Choose Maximum:** `curr = max(11, 10) = 11`.
   - **Update Variables:** `prev2 = 11`, `prev1 = 11`.

3. **At House 4 (Index 4):**
   - **Option 1 (Skip):** `prev1 = 11`.
   - **Option 2 (Rob):** `prev2 + nums[4] = 11 + 1 = 12`.
   - **Choose Maximum:** `curr = max(11, 12) = 12`.
   - **Update Variables:** `prev2 = 11`, `prev1 = 12`.

#### **Final Result**

- The maximum amount that can be robbed is **prev1 = 12**.

---

### **Connecting to the DP Array Solution**

In the DP array, we had:

```python
dp = [2, 7, 11, 11, 12]
```

- **prev1** corresponds to **dp[i - 1]**.
- **prev2** corresponds to **dp[i - 2]**.
- At each iteration, **curr** corresponds to **dp[i]**.

By maintaining only the necessary previous states, we reduce **space complexity** without altering the **logic** or **time complexity**.

---

### **Benefits of Using Two Variables**

- **Space Efficiency:** Reduces space complexity from \(O(n)\) to \(O(1)\).
- **Performance:** Less memory usage can lead to slight performance improvements.
- **Simplicity:** Code becomes more concise and focused.

---

### **Generalizing the Optimization Process**

#### **1. Identify Limited Dependencies**

- Check if the DP solution only requires a fixed number of previous states.

#### **2. Replace DP Array with Variables**

- Use variables to store the necessary previous states instead of an array.

#### **3. Update Variables Iteratively**

- In each iteration, compute the current state and update variables accordingly.

#### **4. Verify Correctness**

- Ensure that the optimized solution produces the same results as the original DP array solution.

---

### **Applying the Technique to Other Problems**

#### **Example: Fibonacci Sequence**

- **Recursive Relation:** \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \)
- **Optimization:** Use two variables instead of an array.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    prev2, prev1 = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        curr = prev1 + prev2
        prev2 = prev1
        prev1 = curr
    return prev1
```

#### **Example: Climbing Stairs (LeetCode 70)**

- **Similar to Fibonacci:** Number of ways to reach the \( n^{th} \) stair depends on the two previous stairs.

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Space Optimization is Possible When:**
  - The current state depends only on a fixed number of previous states.
  - There is no need to retain the entire history of computations.

- **Approach:**
  - **From DP Array to Variables:**
    - Identify the dependency chain.
    - Map array indices to variables.
  - **Update Iteratively:**
    - Use a sliding window concept over the previous states.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Memory Efficient:** Important for large input sizes.
  - **Performance Gain:** Less memory access overhead.

---

### **Conclusion**

By recognizing patterns in the problem's structure, we can optimize our solutions to be more efficient without compromising readability or maintainability. The transition from an array-based DP solution to using two variables hinges on understanding the recurrence relation and the dependencies between states.

---

## Understanding the Two Variable Method Code

The variable names in the code can be confusing, so let's make sure your explanation aligns with the code and understand the main concept together.

---

### **Your Code Review**

```python
def rob(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    prev_max = curr_max = 0
    for num in nums:
        # Calculate the new maximum by deciding to rob or skip the current house
        temp = curr_max
        curr_max = max(prev_max + num, curr_max)
        prev_max = temp

    return curr_max

# Example usage
houses = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]
print(rob(houses))  # Output: 12
```

---

### **Understanding the Variable Roles**

In your code:

- **`prev_max`**: Represents the **maximum amount robbed up to the previous house**.
- **`curr_max`**: Represents the **maximum amount robbed up to the current house**.

However, due to the updating mechanism in the loop, `prev_max` effectively becomes the maximum amount robbed up to the **house before the previous one** after the first iteration.

Let's clarify this with variable renaming and step-by-step explanation.

---

### **Refactored Code with Clear Variable Names**

```python
def rob(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    prev_prev_max = 0  # Max amount up to house i-2
    prev_max = 0       # Max amount up to house i-1

    for num in nums:
        # Calculate the new maximum by deciding to rob or skip the current house
        temp = prev_max
        curr_max = max(prev_prev_max + num, prev_max)
        prev_prev_max = temp
        prev_max = curr_max

    return prev_max

# Example usage
houses = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]
print(rob(houses))  # Output: 12
```

Now, the variables represent:

- **`prev_prev_max` (prev_prev_max)**: Maximum amount robbed up to the **house before the previous one** (`i-2`).
- **`prev_max` (prev_max)**: Maximum amount robbed up to the **previous house** (`i-1`).
- **`curr_max` (curr_max)**: Maximum amount robbed up to the **current house** (`i`).

---

### **Corrected Explanation**

> Understand that `prev_prev_max` here is **not** necessarily the maximum amount including the previous house. Instead, it represents the maximum amount robbed up to the **house before the previous one**, regardless of whether that house was robbed or skipped.
>
> At each step:
>
> - `prev_prev_max + num` means robbing the **current** house by adding its value to the maximum amount robbed up to the **house before the previous one** (`i-2`).
> - `prev_max` represents the maximum amount up to the **previous** house (`i-1`), which could result from either robbing or skipping that house.
> - We choose the maximum between robbing the current house (`prev_prev_max + num`) and skipping it (`prev_max`), updating `curr_max`.
>
> After calculating `curr_max`, we update `prev_prev_max` and `prev_max` for the next iteration.

---

### **Step-by-Step Visualization**

Let's walk through your example `houses = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]` using the refactored code.

#### **Initialization:**

- **`prev_prev_max = 0`**
- **`prev_max = 0`**

#### **Iterative Steps:**

1. **House 0 (Value: 2)**
   - **Calculate `curr_max`:**
     - `curr_max = max(prev_prev_max + num, prev_max)`
     - `curr_max = max(0 + 2, 0) = 2`
   - **Update variables:**
     - `prev_prev_max = prev_max = 0`
     - `prev_max = curr_max = 2`

2. **House 1 (Value: 7)**
   - **Calculate `curr_max`:**
     - `curr_max = max(prev_prev_max + num, prev_max)`
     - `curr_max = max(0 + 7, 2) = 7`
   - **Update variables:**
     - `prev_prev_max = prev_max = 2`
     - `prev_max = curr_max = 7`

3. **House 2 (Value: 9)**
   - **Calculate `curr_max`:**
     - `curr_max = max(prev_prev_max + num, prev_max)`
     - `curr_max = max(2 + 9, 7) = 11`
   - **Update variables:**
     - `prev_prev_max = prev_max = 7`
     - `prev_max = curr_max = 11`

4. **House 3 (Value: 3)**
   - **Calculate `curr_max`:**
     - `curr_max = max(prev_prev_max + num, prev_max)`
     - `curr_max = max(7 + 3, 11) = 11`
   - **Update variables:**
     - `prev_prev_max = prev_max = 11`
     - `prev_max = curr_max = 11`

5. **House 4 (Value: 1)**
   - **Calculate `curr_max`:**
     - `curr_max = max(prev_prev_max + num, prev_max)`
     - `curr_max = max(11 + 1, 11) = 12`
   - **Update variables:**
     - `prev_prev_max = prev_max = 11`
     - `prev_max = curr_max = 12`

#### **Final Result:**

- **Maximum amount that can be robbed:** `prev_max = 12`

---

### **Main Concept Explained**

The goal is to maximize the amount of money robbed without triggering the alarm (by not robbing two adjacent houses).

**Dynamic Programming Approach:**

- **State Definition:**
  - **`dp[i]`**: Maximum amount that can be robbed up to house `i`.

- **Recurrence Relation:**
  - **`dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i])`**
    - **Option 1 (Skip current house):** `dp[i - 1]`
      - The maximum amount up to the previous house.
    - **Option 2 (Rob current house):** `dp[i - 2] + nums[i]`
      - The maximum amount up to the house before the previous one plus the current house's value.

- **Initialization:**
  - **`dp[0] = nums[0]`**
    - If there's only one house, rob it.
  - **`dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])`**
    - For two houses, rob the one with more money.

---

### **Optimizing Space with Two Variables**

Instead of using an array to store `dp[i]`, we observe that we only need the last two computed values (`dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`) to calculate `dp[i]`. Therefore, we can optimize space by using two variables:

- **`prev_prev_max` (dp[i - 2])**
- **`prev_max` (dp[i - 1])**

At each iteration:

1. **Calculate `curr_max`:**
   - `curr_max = max(prev_prev_max + num, prev_max)`
2. **Update variables for the next iteration:**
   - `prev_prev_max = prev_max`
   - `prev_max = curr_max`

This process continues until all houses are processed, and `prev_max` will contain the maximum amount that can be robbed.

---

### **Key Points**

- **`prev_prev_max`** represents the maximum amount robbed up to the **house before the previous one** (`i - 2`), regardless of whether that house was robbed or skipped.
- **`prev_max`** represents the maximum amount robbed up to the **previous house** (`i - 1`).
- **At each house (`i`):**
  - **Rob it:** Add the current house's value to `prev_prev_max`.
  - **Skip it:** Keep `prev_max`.
  - **Choose the maximum of these two options.**

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Your explanation is generally correct**, but the confusion arises from the variable names in the original code.
- **By renaming the variables** to more accurately reflect their roles, the logic becomes clearer.
- **Understanding the DP Relation** helps in grasping how the solution builds upon previous results and why only two variables suffice for optimization.

### **Final Note**

The optimized solution effectively reduces the space complexity from \(O(n)\) to \(O(1)\) by leveraging the fact that only the previous two states are needed to compute the current state.
