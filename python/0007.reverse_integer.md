# 7. Reverse Integer

```python
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        INT_MAX, INT_MIN = 2**31 - 1, -2**31
        
        rev = 0
        sign = 1 if x > 0 else -1
        x = abs(x)
        
        while x:
            last = x % 10
            ## Check if int overflow will happen before storing the value
            if rev > (INT_MAX - last) // 10:
                return 0
            rev = rev * 10 + last
            x //= 10
        
        return rev * sign
```

The question strictly specifies the following:

> Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Hence, the condition `if rev > (INT_MAX - last) // 10:` is critical to the 
problem because it makes sure that we are not saving any integer value which may
exceed the `INT_MAX` value.
