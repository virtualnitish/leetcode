# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
    stack, result = [], []
    current = root
    while stack or current:
        while current:
            stack.append(current)
            current = current.left
        current = stack.pop()
        result.append(current.val)
        if len(result) == k:
            return result[-1]
        current = current.right

# Example usage:
# Constructing a binary search tree (BST):
#      3
#     / \
#    1   4
#     \
#      2
tree = TreeNode(3)
tree.left = TreeNode(1)
tree.right = TreeNode(4)
tree.left.right = TreeNode(2)

print(kthSmallest(tree, 2))  # Output: 2
```

1. **Core Trick**:
   The core trick used in this solution is **in-order traversal** of the binary search tree (BST). In-order traversal of a BST visits nodes in ascending order. The iteration must stop once you've reached `k`th element.

2. **Time & Space Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(k), where k is the given input for the kth smallest element. The traversal stops as soon as we reach the kth element.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This space is used by the call stack during recursion. In the best case (balanced tree), the space complexity is O(log n), and in the worst case (completely unbalanced tree), it is O(n).

## Recursive Method

```python
def kthSmallest(root: TreeNode, k: int) -> int:
    def inOrderTraversal(node):
        if node:
            yield from inOrderTraversal(node.left)
            yield node.val
            yield from inOrderTraversal(node.right)

    # Generator to yield elements in sorted order
    generator = inOrderTraversal(root)
    for _ in range(k - 1):
        next(generator)
    return next(generator)
```


By traversing the tree in order and using a generator, we can yield nodes' values one by one, effectively getting the kth smallest element without needing to store all elements.
