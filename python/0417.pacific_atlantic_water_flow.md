# 417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow

```python
def pacificAtlantic(heights):
    if not heights or not heights[0]:

    rows, cols = len(heights), len(heights[0])
    
    def dfs(r, c, visit_set):
        visit_set.add((r, c))
        for dr, dc in ((1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)):
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and (nr, nc) not in visit_set and heights[nr][nc] >= heights[r][c]:

    [1, 2, 2, 3, 5],
    [3, 2, 3, 4, 4],
    [2, 4, 5, 3, 1],
    [6, 7, 1, 4, 5],
    [5, 1, 1, 2, 4]

```

We are checking `heights[nr][nc] >= heights[r][c]` because we are flowing 
**inwards** from the ocean. So, heights would be compared in reverse order
instead of checking next height as lower or equal.

### Explanation
1. **Approach**: The problem is solved using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** from the edges of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. By starting DFS from the ocean boundaries and marking cells that can flow into each ocean, we can determine the intersection of the cells that can reach both oceans.
2. **Steps**:
   - Identify the cells adjacent to the Pacific Ocean (left and top edges) and the Atlantic Ocean (right and bottom edges).
   - Perform DFS from these cells, tracking reachable cells for each ocean.
   - The final result is the intersection of cells reachable by both DFS processes.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(M \times N)\), where \(M\) is the number of rows and \(N\) is the number of columns. Each cell is processed at most once per ocean.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(M \times N)\) for the visited sets used in DFS.
