# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Time Complexity: `O(n)`


```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        charSet = set()
        l = 0 #left pointer
        res = 0

        for r in range(len(s)): # right pointer
            while s[r] in charSet:
                charSet.remove(s[l])
                l += 1
            charSet.add(s[r])
            res = max(res, r - l + 1)
        return res
```

This uses Sliding Window method.   
Take `abcbcbb` as example. When you are at second repeated `b`, you remove from
the left until the repeated `b` is removed. `r-l+1` calculates the current
length of the window on the fly.
