# 53. Maximum Subarray

You don't need to think of the problem in terms of subarray. 
The end goal is to return the sum of the numbers. So think of a way to maintain 
the sum rather than sliding or shrinking the window literally using `start` 
and `end` variables.

> While Kadane's Algorithm and sliding window share the common goal of processing 
subarrays efficiently, Kadane's Algorithm is more accurately categorized under 
dynamic programming due to its approach to summing subarrays. 
It doesn't explicitly manage a window's boundaries, which is a hallmark of the 
sliding window technique.


```python
## A variant of Kadane's Algorithm
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max_sum = nums[0]

        curr_sum = 0
        for n in nums:
            curr_sum += n
            max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)
            if curr_sum < 0:
                curr_sum = 0
        return max_sum
```

```python
## Kadane's Algorithm
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max_sum = nums[0]
        curr_sum = nums[0]

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            curr_sum = max(nums[i], curr_sum+nums[i])
            max_sum = max(curr_sum, max_sum)
        return max_sum
