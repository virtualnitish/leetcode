# 100. Same Tree

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def isSameTree(p, q):
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        # Base case: Both nodes empty
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        if p and q and p.val == q.val:
            return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
        else:
            # If the values of the current nodes are different
            # If one of the trees is empty and the other is not
            return False

# Example usage:
# Create two binary trees:
# Tree 1:     1         Tree 2:     1
#           /   \                /   \
#          2     3              2     3
p = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2), TreeNode(3))
q = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2), TreeNode(3))

print(isSameTree(p, q))
```

### Approach:
The trick here is to recursively compare the corresponding nodes of both trees. If the values of the current nodes are the same and their left and right subtrees are also the same, then the entire trees are the same.

### Time & Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where n is the number of nodes in each tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(h)`, where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack space. In the worst case (skewed tree), the height can be n, making the space complexity `O(n)`. In the best case (balanced tree), the height is `log(n)`, making the space complexity `O(log n)`.

## Iterative Method

In case the interviewer doesn't like you and asks for iterative method.

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        queue = deque([(p, q)])
        
        while queue:
            node1, node2 = queue.popleft()
            
            if not node1 and not node2:
                continue
            if not node1 or not node2:
                return False
            if node1.val != node2.val:
                return False
            
            queue.append((node1.left, node2.left))
            queue.append((node1.right, node2.right))
        
        return True
```
