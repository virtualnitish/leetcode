# 347. Top K Frequent Elements

## Using Bucket Sort [O(n)]

The *trick* to this method is to use count or frequency of the elements
as the index rather than the element itself. 

So, the bucket size will be length of the `nums` input array rather than 
the maximum element from nums.   

```python
def topKFrequent(nums, k):
    # Step 1: Create a frequency dictionary
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    for n in nums:
        freq[n] += 1

    # Step 2: Create buckets where index represents frequency
    bucket = [[] for _ in range(len(nums) + 1)]
    for n, count in freq.items():
        bucket[count].append(n)
    
    # Step 3: Flatten the bucket list and get the top k frequent elements
    result = []
    for i in range(len(bucket) - 1, 0, -1):
        for n in bucket[i]:
            result.append(n)
            if len(result) == k:
                return result

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
k = 2
print(topKFrequent(nums, k))  # Output: [1, 2]
```

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of elements in `nums`. Building the frequency dictionary takes O(N), and placing elements into buckets also takes O(N). Collecting the top `k` frequent elements from the buckets takes O(N) in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the space needed for the frequency dictionary and the buckets.


### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Frequency Counting:**
   - Initialize an empty dictionary `count = {}`.
   - Iterate over `nums`.
     - For the first element `1`, update `count` to `{1: 1}`.
     - For the second element `1`, update `count` to `{1: 2}`.
     - For the third element `1`, update `count` to `{1: 3}`.
     - For the fourth element `2`, update `count` to `{1: 3, 2: 1}`.
     - For the fifth element `2`, update `count` to `{1: 3, 2: 2}`.
     - For the sixth element `3`, update `count` to `{1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}`.

   **Result after Step 1:**
   ```python
   count = {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}
   ```

2. **Grouping Elements by Frequency:**
   - Create a list of empty lists `freq = [[] for i in range(len(nums) + 1)]`, resulting in `freq = [[], [], [], [], [], [], []]` (one extra to handle 0 frequency, which won't be used).
   - Iterate over the `count` dictionary.
     - For element `1` with frequency `3`, update `freq` to `freq = [[], [], [], [1], [], [], []]`.
     - For element `2` with frequency `2`, update `freq` to `freq = [[], [], [2], [1], [], [], []]`.
     - For element `3` with frequency `1`, update `freq` to `freq = [[], [3], [2], [1], [], [], []]`.

   **Result after Step 2:**
   ```python
   freq = [[], [3], [2], [1], [], [], []]
   ```

3. **Collecting the Top k Frequent Elements:**
   - Initialize an empty list `res = []`.
   - Iterate over `freq` from the end (highest frequency) to the start.
     - At `i = 6`, `5`, `4`, `res` remains unchanged as `freq[6]`, `5`, `4` are empty.
     - At `i = 3`, extend `res` with `freq[3]`, so `res = [1]`.
     - At `i = 2`, extend `res` with `freq[2]`, so `res = [1, 2]`.
     - Now `len(res) = 2`, which is equal to `k`, so return `res[:k]`.

   **Final Result:**
   ```python
   res = [1, 2]
   ```

### Summary
- **Step 1:** Count the frequency of each element.
- **Step 2:** Group elements by their frequencies into buckets.
- **Step 3:** Collect the top `k` frequent elements by iterating over the buckets from highest to lowest frequency.

This process ensures we efficiently get the `k` most frequent elements in linear time complexity.


## Using Heap [O(nlogk)]

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import heapq

def topKFrequent(nums, k):
    # Step 1: Create a frequency dictionary
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] += 1
    
    # Step 2: Use a min-heap to keep track of the top k frequent elements
    min_heap = []
    for num, count in freq.items():
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (count, num))
        if len(min_heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)
    
    # Step 3: Extract the elements from the heap to get the result
    result = []
    while min_heap:
        result.append(heapq.heappop(min_heap)[1])
    
    return result[::-1]  # Return the result in descending order of frequency

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
k = 2
print(topKFrequent(nums, k))  # Output: [1, 2]
```

**Time Complexity:** `O(Nlog(k))` where `N` is the number of elements in nums and `k` is the number of top frequent elements. Building the frequency dictionary takes `O(N)`, and maintaining the heap with at most k elements requires `O(log k)` operations for each of the `N` elements.

**Space Complexity:** `O(N+k)` , where N is the space needed for the frequency dictionary, and `k` is the space needed for the heap.
