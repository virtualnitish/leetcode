# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def maxDepth(root: TreeNode) -> int:
    if not root:
        return 0
    left_depth = maxDepth(root.left)
    right_depth = maxDepth(root.right)
    return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1

# Example usage:
# Constructing a binary tree:
#     3
#    / \
#   9  20
#     /  \
#    15   7
tree = TreeNode(3)
tree.left = TreeNode(9)
tree.right = TreeNode(20)
tree.right.left = TreeNode(15)
tree.right.right = TreeNode(7)

print(maxDepth(tree))  # Output: 3
```

### Shorter version

```python
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        return max(self.maxDepth(root.left), self.maxDepth(root.right)) + 1
```


**Time & Space Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once.
   - **Space Complexity**: `O(h)`, where h is the height of the tree. This is the space taken up by the call stack during recursion, which in the worst case is the height of the tree. In a balanced tree, this would be O(log n), and in the worst case (a completely unbalanced tree), it would be O(n).
