# 252. Meeting Rooms

```python
def can_attend(intervals):
    # Sort intervals by start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        # If current meeting starts before previous one ends, return False
        if intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage:
meetings = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
print(can_attend(meetings))  # Output: False
```

1. **Explanation of the approach:**

   The key idea is to detect any overlapping meetings. By sorting the intervals based on their start times, we ensure that any potential overlaps will be adjacent in the list. We then iterate through the sorted intervals and compare the start time of the current meeting with the end time of the previous meeting. If the current meeting starts before the previous one ends, there's a conflict, and we return `False`. If no overlaps are found, we return `True`.

2. **Time and Space Complexity:**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of meetings. The sorting step dominates the time complexity.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) if sorting is done in place, otherwise O(n) due to the space used by the sorting algorithm.

## Alternate Solution

Certainly! Exploring different approaches can deepen our understanding of the problem. Here are some alternative methods to solve the **Meeting Rooms** problem:

### **Sweep Line Algorithm**

Instead of just sorting by start times, we can process all the start and end events chronologically using a sweep line approach.    
The **sweep line algorithm** is a powerful method for interval-related problems, especially when events can overlap in complex ways.   

```python
def can_attend_meetings(intervals):
    events = []
    for start, end in intervals:
        events.append((start, 'start'))
        events.append((end, 'end'))
    # Sort events; if times are equal, 'end' comes before 'start'
    events.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
    
    ongoing_meetings = 0
    for time, event_type in events:
        if event_type == 'start':
            ongoing_meetings += 1
            if ongoing_meetings > 1:
                return False
        else:
            ongoing_meetings -= 1
    return True

# Example usage:
meetings = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
print(can_attend_meetings(meetings))  # Output: False
```

**Explanation:**

- **Concept:** We treat meeting start and end times as separate events.
- **Process:**
  - Create a list of all events, marking each as a 'start' or 'end'.
  - Sort the events by time; when times are equal, 'end' events precede 'start' events to avoid false overlaps.
  - Traverse the sorted events:
    - Increment `ongoing_meetings` for 'start' events.
    - Decrement for 'end' events.
    - If `ongoing_meetings` exceeds 1, meetings overlap.

The time complexity of the Sweep Line Algorithm in this answer is **O(n log n)**.

- **Sorting Events:** The most time-consuming step is sorting all the start and end events, which takes O(n log n) time where n is the total number of intervals.
- **Processing Events:** After sorting, we iterate through the events once, which takes O(n) time.

Since the sorting step dominates, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**.
