# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def lowestCommonAncestor(root: TreeNode, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
    current = root
    
    while current:
        # If both nodes are greater than current, LCA lies in the right subtree
        if p.val > current.val and q.val > current.val:
            current = current.right
        # If both nodes are smaller than current, LCA lies in the left subtree
        elif p.val < current.val and q.val < current.val:
            current = current.left
        # Else, current node is the LCA
        else:
            return current


root = TreeNode(6)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(8)
root.left.left = TreeNode(0)
root.left.right = TreeNode(4)
root.right.left = TreeNode(7)
root.right.right = TreeNode(9)
p = root.left  # Node with value 2
q = root.right  # Node with value 8

print("LCA of p and q:", lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q).val)  # Output: 6
```

### Explanation:
The non-recursive approach leverages the properties of the Binary Search Tree (BST):
1. If both `p` and `q` are greater than the current node, the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) must be in the right subtree.
2. If both `p` and `q` are smaller than the current node, the LCA must be in the left subtree.
3. Otherwise, the current node is the LCA.

We use a `while` loop to traverse the tree iteratively, checking these conditions at each node.

### Time & Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree. We traverse from the root to the LCA, which in the worst case is the depth of the tree. For a balanced tree, it's O(log N); for a skewed tree, it's O(N).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are not using any additional data structures apart from variables to keep track of the current node.
