# 269. Alien Dictionary

## Using Kahn's algorithm

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def alien_order(words):
    # Build the graph
    adj = defaultdict(set)
    in_degree = {ch: 0 for word in words for ch in word}

    for w1, w2 in zip(words, words[1:]):
        for c1, c2 in zip(w1, w2):
            if c1 != c2:
                if c2 not in adj[c1]:
                    adj[c1].add(c2)
                    in_degree[c2] += 1
                break
        else:
            if len(w2) < len(w1):
                return ""  # Invalid case where prefix comes after word

    # Topological sort
    queue = deque([ch for ch in in_degree if in_degree[ch] == 0])
    res = []
    while queue:
        ch = queue.popleft()
        res.append(ch)
        for nei in adj[ch]:
            in_degree[nei] -= 1
            if in_degree[nei] == 0:
                queue.append(nei)

    if len(res) != len(in_degree):
        return ""  # Cycle detected

    return ''.join(res)

# Example usage:
words = ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"]
print(alien_order(words))  # Output: "wertf"
```

1. **Approach:**

   We treat each character as a node in a graph and infer the ordering by comparing adjacent words. By finding the first differing characters between words, we can establish directed edges indicating precedence. We then perform a topological sort (Kahn's algorithm) to determine a valid character order that respects these precedence constraints.

2. **Time & Space Complexity:**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(C), where C is the total number of characters in all words. Building the graph and performing the topological sort each take O(C) time.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1), since the number of unique characters is bounded by the alphabet size (up to 26 letters), the extra space used for the graph and in-degree counts is constant relative to input size.

Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the solution for the Alien Dictionary problem. By the end of this explanation, you'll have a solid grasp of the concepts and be well-prepared to tackle similar questions in an interview.

### **Problem Statement**

Given a list of words sorted lexicographically according to an unknown alien language, determine the order of characters in the alien alphabet. If no valid ordering exists, return an empty string. If multiple valid orderings are possible, you can return any of them.

---

### **Understanding the Problem**

Imagine you have a sorted list of words in an unknown language:

```python
words = ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"]
```

Your task is to deduce the ordering of characters in the alien alphabet based on the differences between these words.

---

### **High-Level Approach**

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Treat each unique character as a node.
   - Establish directed edges between characters based on their ordering in adjacent words.

2. **Topological Sorting**:
   - Perform a topological sort on the constructed graph to determine a valid character order.

3. **Cycle Detection**:
   - If a cycle is detected, return an empty string since no valid ordering exists.

---

### **Step-by-Step Code Explanation**

Let's break down the code and understand each section.

#### **1. Import Necessary Libraries**

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque
```

- **defaultdict**: A dictionary that provides a default value for non-existent keys.
- **deque**: A double-ended queue optimized for append and pop operations from both ends.

---

#### **2. Define the Function**

```python
def alien_order(words):
```

- `alien_order` is the function that takes a list of words and returns the alien alphabet order.

---

#### **3. Initialize Data Structures**

```python
# Build the graph
adjacency = defaultdict(set)
in_degree = {char: 0 for word in words for char in word}
```

- **adjacency**: Represents the graph where each character points to its successors.
- **in_degree**: Counts the number of incoming edges for each character.

**Explanation**:

- We initialize `in_degree` for every unique character in the words with 0.
- Using a `set` in `adjacency` ensures we don't duplicate edges between the same nodes.

---

#### **4. Build the Graph by Comparing Words**

```python
for first_word, second_word in zip(words, words[1:]):
    for c1, c2 in zip(first_word, second_word):
        if c1 != c2:
            if c2 not in adjacency[c1]:
                adjacency[c1].add(c2)
                in_degree[c2] += 1
            break
    else:
        if len(second_word) < len(first_word):
            return ""  # Invalid case where a word is prefix of the previous word
```

**Process**:

- **Pairwise Comparison**:
  - We compare adjacent words to find the first differing character.
  - This difference indicates the ordering between two characters.

**Detailed Explanation**:

- **Outer Loop**: Iterates over pairs of adjacent words.

  ```python
  for first_word, second_word in zip(words, words[1:]):
  ```

- **Inner Loop**: Compares characters of the two words.

  ```python
  for c1, c2 in zip(first_word, second_word):
  ```

- **First Differing Character**:
  - When `c1 != c2`, we know that `c1` comes before `c2` in the alien language.
  - We add `c2` to the adjacency list of `c1` and increment the in-degree of `c2`.

  ```python
  if c1 != c2:
      if c2 not in adjacency[c1]:
          adjacency[c1].add(c2)
          in_degree[c2] += 1
      break
  ```

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - If `second_word` is a prefix of `first_word`, it's invalid.

  ```python
  else:
      if len(second_word) < len(first_word):
          return ""  # Invalid case
  ```

**Visualization**:

Let's visualize the process with the given list `["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"]`.

- **Comparing "wrt" and "wrf"**:
  - `c1 = 't'`, `c2 = 'f'`
  - Since `'t' != 'f'`, we add an edge from `'t'` to `'f'`.

- **Comparing "wrf" and "er"**:
  - `c1 = 'w'`, `c2 = 'e'`
  - `'w' != 'e'` ⇒ Edge: `'w'` → `'e'`

- **Comparing "er" and "ett"**:
  - `c1 = 'r'`, `c2 = 't'`
  - `'r' != 't'` ⇒ Edge: `'r'` → `'t'`

- **Comparing "ett" and "rftt"**:
  - `c1 = 'e'`, `c2 = 'r'`
  - `'e' != 'r'` ⇒ Edge: `'e'` → `'r'`

**Resulting Graph**:

- Adjacency List:

  ```
  {
      't': {'f'},
      'w': {'e'},
      'r': {'t'},
      'e': {'r'}
  }
  ```

- In-degree Count:

  ```
  {
      'w': 0,
      'r': 1,
      't': 1,
      'f': 1,
      'e': 1
  }
  ```

---

#### **5. Perform Topological Sort**

```python
# Topological sort
queue = deque([char for char in in_degree if in_degree[char] == 0])
order = []
while queue:
    char = queue.popleft()
    order.append(char)
    for neighbor in adjacency[char]:
        in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
        if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
            queue.append(neighbor)
```

**Explanation**:

- **Initialize the Queue**:
  - Start with characters that have an in-degree of 0 (no dependencies).

  ```python
  queue = deque([char for char in in_degree if in_degree[char] == 0])
  ```

- **Process the Queue**:
  - While the queue is not empty:
    - Remove a character from the front.
    - Append it to the `order` list.
    - Decrease the in-degree of its neighbors.
    - If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.

**Step-by-Step Execution**:

1. **Initial Queue**: `['w']` (since `'w'` has in-degree 0)
2. **Processing 'w'**:
   - `order = ['w']`
   - Neighbor: `'e'`
   - Decrement in-degree of `'e'` to 0
   - Queue: `['e']`
3. **Processing 'e'**:
   - `order = ['w', 'e']`
   - Neighbor: `'r'`
   - Decrement in-degree of `'r'` to 0
   - Queue: `['r']`
4. **Processing 'r'**:
   - `order = ['w', 'e', 'r']`
   - Neighbor: `'t'`
   - Decrement in-degree of `'t'` to 0
   - Queue: `['t']`
5. **Processing 't'**:
   - `order = ['w', 'e', 'r', 't']`
   - Neighbor: `'f'`
   - Decrement in-degree of `'f'` to 0
   - Queue: `['f']`
6. **Processing 'f'**:
   - `order = ['w', 'e', 'r', 't', 'f']`
   - No neighbors
   - Queue: `[]`

**Final Order**: `['w', 'e', 'r', 't', 'f']`

---

#### **6. Check for Cycles and Compile Result**

```python
if len(order) != len(in_degree):
    return ""  # Cycle detected

return ''.join(order)
```

- **Cycle Detection**:
  - If the length of `order` is less than the number of unique characters, a cycle exists.
- **Return Result**:
  - Join the list `order` into a string.

**In Our Case**:

- `len(order) = 5`
- `len(in_degree) = 5`
- No cycle detected.
- Final output: `"wertf"`

---

#### **7. Example Usage**

```python
# Example usage:
words = ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"]
print(alien_order(words))  # Output: "wertf"
```

---

### **Visual Representation**

**Graph Structure**:

```
w ──► e ──► r ──► t ──► f
```

- **Nodes**: Characters
- **Edges**: Directed edges indicating ordering

---

### **Understanding with Another Example**

Let's consider an example that introduces a cycle.

**Words**:

```python
words = ["abc", "ab"]
```

**Process**:

- Comparing `"abc"` and `"ab"`:
  - `"ab"` is a prefix of `"abc"`, and it comes after `"abc"` in the list.
  - This is invalid per the problem's constraints.

**Outcome**:

- The function returns an empty string `""`.

---

### **Time and Space Complexity**

**Time Complexity**: O(N \* L)

- **N**: Number of words
- **L**: Average length of words
- We process each character in each word once.

**Space Complexity**: O(1)

- The maximum number of unique characters (nodes) is 26 (letters of the English alphabet).
- The adjacency list and in-degree dictionary sizes are bounded by 26.

---

### **Key Concepts to Understand**

1. **Graph Theory**:

   - **Directed Graphs**: Edges have a direction, indicating a relationship from one node to another.
   - **Cycles**: A path that starts and ends at the same node. In the context of this problem, cycles indicate conflicting character orders.

2. **Topological Sort**:

   - Ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where for each directed edge from vertex U to vertex V, U comes before V in the ordering.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:

   - We use BFS in the topological sort by utilizing a queue to process nodes with in-degree 0.

---

### **Interview Preparation Tips**

- **Explain Your Solution Clearly**:
  - Walk through your approach step by step.
  - Use examples to illustrate how your algorithm works.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - Mention how your code handles invalid inputs, such as cycles or invalid prefix cases.

- **Optimize for Clarity**:
  - Use meaningful variable names.
  - Keep your code clean and well-commented where necessary.

- **Be Prepared to Discuss Alternatives**:
  - Know different methods to solve the problem and their trade-offs.

---

### **Practice Problem**

Try solving the following to test your understanding:

**Problem**:

Given a list:

```python
words = ["z", "x", "z"]
```

- What should your function return?

**Solution**:

- **Graph Construction**:
  - Compare `"z"` and `"x"` ⇒ Edge: `'z'` → `'x'`
  - Compare `"x"` and `"z"` ⇒ Edge: `'x'` → `'z'`

- **Cycle Detection**:
  - The graph contains a cycle (`'z'` ↔ `'x'`).
  - The function should return an empty string `""`.

---

### **Deepening Your Understanding**

**Why Use Topological Sort?**

- **Dependency Resolution**:
  - Topological sorting is ideal for ordering tasks that have dependencies, such as build tasks in a compiler or, in this case, characters in an alien language.

**What If Multiple Orders Are Possible?**

- The problem allows for any valid order.
- If multiple characters have an in-degree of 0, the choice of which character to process first can lead to different valid orders.

- **Thoroughly Understand the Problem**: Ensure you know what is being asked.
- **Choose the Right Data Structures**: Graphs and queues are essential here.
- **Handle Edge Cases Carefully**: Always consider invalid inputs.

## Using DFS

```python
def alien_order(words):
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Initialize adjacency list and visit state for each character
    adjacency = defaultdict(list)
    visited = {}  # States: 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited

    # Collect all unique characters
    for word in words:
        for char in word:
            visited[char] = 0

    # Build the graph by adding edges based on the ordering of characters
    for i in range(len(words) - 1):
        word1, word2 = words[i], words[i + 1]
        min_len = min(len(word1), len(word2))

        # Check for invalid case where prefix comes after the word
        if len(word1) > len(word2) and word1.startswith(word2):
            return ""

        for j in range(min_len):
            if word1[j] != word2[j]:
                adjacency[word1[j]].append(word2[j])
                break

    # Result list and a flag to detect cycles
    result = []
    is_possible = True

    # Depth-First Search function
    def dfs(char):
        nonlocal is_possible
        if not is_possible:
            return
        visited[char] = 1  # Mark as visiting
        for neighbor in adjacency[char]:
            if visited[neighbor] == 0:
                dfs(neighbor)
            elif visited[neighbor] == 1:
                is_possible = False  # Cycle detected
                return
        visited[char] = 2  # Mark as visited
        result.append(char)

    # Perform DFS on each unvisited node
    for char in visited:
        if visited[char] == 0:
            dfs(char)
            if not is_possible:
                return ""

    # Return the characters in reverse topological order
    return ''.join(result[::-1])
```

**Summary:**

The code solves the Alien Dictionary problem using a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach for topological sorting. It builds a directed graph by comparing adjacent words to establish precedence relationships between characters. The `visited` dictionary keeps track of the traversal state of each character to detect cycles. If a cycle is found, the function returns an empty string, indicating that no valid ordering exists. The characters are appended to the `result` list upon completion of their DFS traversal, and the final order is obtained by reversing this list.
