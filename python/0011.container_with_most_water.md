# 11. Container With Most Water

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_water = 0

        while l < r:
            water = (r - l) * min(height[l], height[r])
            max_water = max(max_water, water)

            if height[l] < height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        
        return max_water
```

**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`    
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`    

The "trick" to move the two pointer is realise we take `min()` of the both heights
so we need to maximize the shortest end. Also, with each move you are moving 
closer to each other so the `(r-l)` value keeps decreasing. So, we need to 
focus on increasing the minimum height.
