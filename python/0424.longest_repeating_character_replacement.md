# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

```python
def characterReplacement(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    l = 0
    max_len = 0
    char_count = {}

    # Traverse through the string
    for r in range(len(s)):
        # Count occurrences of each character
        char_count[s[r]] = char_count.get(s[r], 0) + 1

        # Calculate window size
        while r - l + 1 - max(char_count.values()) > k:
            char_count[s[l]] -= 1
            l += 1

        # Update max length of valid window
        max_len = max(max_len, r - l + 1)

    return max_len
```



- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` because we traverse the string `s` with a sliding window in linear time.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (if considering the character set size is constant) or `O(m)` where `m` is the number of unique characters in the input string.

### Core "Trick" of Solution:
- **Anchor Keywords:** Sliding Window, Character Frequency, Max Count, Window Shrink.
- **Key Insight:** Maintain a frequency count of characters in the current window. Adjust the window size to ensure the number of required replacements within the window does not exceed `k`.
