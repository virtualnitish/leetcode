# 200. Number of Islands

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: list[list[str]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return 0

        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visited = set()
        no_of_islands = 0
        # Direction: Right, Left, Down, Up
        directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

        def bfs(r, c):
            queue = deque([(r, c)])
            visited.add((r, c))
            while queue:
                x, y = queue.popleft()
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and (nx, ny) not in visited and grid[nx][ny] == "1":
                        queue.append((nx, ny))
                        visited.add((nx, ny))

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == "1" and (r, c) not in visited:
                    bfs(r, c)
                    no_of_islands += 1

        return no_of_islands
```


### Time Complexity:
The BFS/DFS traversal visits every cell once. Thus, the time complexity is **O(m \* n)**, where **m** is the number of rows and **n** is the number of columns in the grid.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is **O(min(m, n))** for BFS/DFS, due to the maximum size of the queue or recursion stack, plus **O(m \* n)** for the visited set or boolean grid. So overall, the space complexity is **O(m \* n)**.

## DFS Approach


```python
def numIslands(grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0

    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    num_islands = 0

    def dfs(r, c):
        # If out of bounds or water ('0'), return
        if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= rows or c >= cols or grid[r][c] == '0':
            return
        grid[r][c] = '0'  # Mark the cell as visited by setting it to '0'
        # Explore all adjacent cells
        dfs(r + 1, c)
        dfs(r - 1, c)
        dfs(r, c + 1)
        dfs(r, c - 1)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == '1':  # Found an unvisited island
                num_islands += 1
                dfs(r, c)

    return num_islands

# Example usage
example_grid = [
    ["1", "1", "1", "1", "0"],
    ["1", "1", "0", "1", "0"],
    ["1", "1", "0", "0", "0"],
    ["0", "0", "0", "0", "0"]
]

print(numIslands(example_grid))  # Output: 1
```

### Explanation of the approach:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We use DFS to explore each island. When we find a '1', we increment our island count and use DFS to mark all adjacent '1's as '0' to avoid counting them again.
- **Mutating the Grid**: By marking the visited cells directly in the grid, we avoid using additional space for a visited array.
  
### Time & Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. We visit each cell at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) in the worst case due to the recursion stack, where every cell is part of the island.
