# 1. Two Sum

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    # Dictionary to store numbers and their indices
    num_index = {}

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Calculate the complement
        comp = target - num

        # Check if the comp is in the dictionary
        if comp in num_index:
            return [num_index[comp], i]

        # Store the number and its index
        num_index[num] = i

# Example usage
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = two_sum(nums, target)
print("Indices of the numbers adding up to target:", result)
```

1. **Core Trick**: The key trick is using a dictionary (hash map) to store each number's index as we iterate through the list. For each number, we calculate the complement (`target - num`). If the complement is already in the dictionary, we have found the two numbers that add up to the target. This allows for a fast lookup in constant time.

2. **Time & Space Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where n is the number of elements in the list. We traverse the list once, and each lookup or insert operation in the dictionary takes `O(1)` on average.
   - **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, where n is the number of elements in the list. In the worst case, we store all n elements in the dictionary.


Use `enumerate` when you need both index and value in a loop.
Don't use it when modifying the original list.
