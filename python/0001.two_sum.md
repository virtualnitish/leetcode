# 1. Two Sum

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    num_dict = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        diff = target - num
        if diff in num_dict:
            return [num_dict[diff], i]
        num_dict[num] = i
    return []

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(twoSum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

Use `enumerate` when you need both index and value in a loop.
Don't use it when modifying the original list.
