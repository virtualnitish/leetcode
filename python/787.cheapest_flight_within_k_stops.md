# 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

```python
class Solution:
   def findCheapestPrice(
      self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, k: int
   ) -> int:
      # Initialize prices to reach each node as infinity
      prices = [float("inf")] * n
      # The price to reach the source node is 0
      prices[src] = 0

      # Iterate up to k+1 times (k stops means k+1 edges)
      for i in range(k + 1):
         # Create a temporary copy of prices to store updates for this iteration
         tmpPrices = prices.copy()

         # Iterate over all flights
         for s, d, p in flights:  # s=source, d=dest, p=price
            # If the source node has not been reached yet, skip this flight
            if prices[s] == float("inf"):
               continue
            # If a cheaper price to reach destination d is found, update tmpPrices
            if prices[s] + p < tmpPrices[d]:
               tmpPrices[d] = prices[s] + p
         # Update prices with the new values from tmpPrices
         prices = tmpPrices

      # If the destination node is still infinity, return -1 (no such route)
      return -1 if prices[dst] == float("inf") else prices[dst]

The solution uses a bit modified version of Bellman-Ford Algorithm

### Why Use `tmpPrices`:
1. **Limited Iterations (`k+1` Iterations)**:
   - The problem requires finding the cheapest flight price with at most `k` stops, meaning we should only consider up to `k+1` edge relaxations (where `k+1` includes the initial source node).

2. **Preventing Premature Updates**:
   - In the given problem, each iteration represents considering flights with a certain number of stops. By using a temporary list `tmpPrices`, the algorithm ensures that all flights in the current iteration are processed based on the prices from the previous iteration, not affecting each other within the same iteration.
   - This distinction ensures that flights considered in the current iteration do not influence others in the same iteration cycle, which might otherwise lead to incorrect results.

### Difference from Original Bellman-Ford:
- **Original Bellman-Ford**: In the traditional Bellman-Ford algorithm, all vertices are processed for `V-1` iterations (where `V` is the number of vertices), allowing all shortest paths to converge. Since each vertex update is propagated in sequence, there's no need for a temporary list as all edges are relaxed multiple times, ensuring convergence.
- **Modified for K Stops**: The modified version considers flights with at most `k` stops. To ensure flights from the current iteration (number of stops) do not influence others prematurely, a temporary list `tmpPrices` is used to store updated prices for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `prices[src] = 0`: Sets the price to reach the source vertex to `0`.
   - `prices = [float("inf")] * n`: Initializes prices to reach all other vertices as infinity.

2. **Iterate `k+1` times**:
   - Outer loop: Iterates up to `k+1` times to relax edges for up to `k` stops.
   - `tmpPrices = prices.copy()`: Creates a copy of the current prices to ensure updates within the current iteration do not affect other flights in the same iteration.

3. **Relaxation**:
   - Inner loop: Iterates over all flights (edges) and updates the `tmpPrices` list if a cheaper price is found via the current flight.
   - `if prices[s] + p < tmpPrices[d]`: Updates the price to reach destination `d` if a cheaper price is found through source `s`.

4. **Update Prices**:
   - `prices = tmpPrices`: After processing all flights for the current iteration, updates the `prices` list with the new prices for the next iteration.

5. **Result**:
   - `return -1 if prices[dst] == float("inf") else prices[dst]`: Returns the final cheapest price to reach the destination within `k` stops or `-1` if no such price exists.

By using `tmpPrices`, the algorithm ensures that the current iteration's updates are only applied after all flights have been considered, preserving the integrity of the constraints (`k` stops).
