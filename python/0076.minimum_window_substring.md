# 76. Minimum Window Substring

```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if len(s) < len(t):
            return ""
        
        countT, window = {}, {}
        for c in t:
            countT[c] = 1 + countT.get(c, 0)

        have, need = 0, len(countT)
        res, resLen = [-1, -1], float("infinity")
        l = 0

        for r in range(len(s)):
            c = s[r]
            window[c] = 1 + window.get(c, 0)

            if c in countT and window[c] == countT[c]:
                have += 1

            # Shrink the window from the left when all required characters are within the window
            while have == need:
                # Update result if the current window is smaller
                if (r - l + 1) < resLen:
                    res = [l, r]
                    resLen = r - l + 1

                # Remove the leftmost character and update 'have' if needed
                window[s[l]] -= 1
                if s[l] in countT and window[s[l]] < countT[s[l]]:
                    have -= 1
                l += 1

        l, r = res
        return s[l : r + 1] if resLen != float("infinity") else ""
```

**Time Complexity:** `O(n+m)`    
**Space Complexity:** `O(n)`    


### Approach
The problem requires us to find the smallest substring in `s` that contains all the characters of `t` in any order. The solution uses the sliding window technique to efficiently find this substring.

1. **Count the Characters in `t`:**
   - First, we count the frequency of each character in `t` and store it in `countT`.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - We use two dictionaries, `countT` and `window`, to keep track of the character counts in `t` and the current window of `s`, respectively.
   - Variables `have` and `need` are used to track how many unique characters in `t` have been fully matched in the current window of `s`.
   - `res` stores the start and end indices of the smallest window found so far, and `resLen` keeps track of the length of this window.
   - Two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), are used to define the window's boundaries.

3. **Expand and Contract the Window:**
   - We expand the window by moving the `r` pointer to the right.
   - For each character `c` at position `r`, we update the `window` dictionary.
   - If `c` is in `countT` and the count in `window` matches the count in `countT`, we increment `have`.

4. **Shrink the Window:**
   - When all characters in `t` are present in the current window (`have == need`), we try to shrink the window from the left by moving the `l` pointer.
   - We update `res` and `resLen` if we find a smaller valid window.
   - We decrement the count of the character at position `l` in the `window` dictionary and update `have` if necessary.

5. **Extract the Result:**
   - After processing all characters in `s`, we extract the smallest window from `s` based on `res`.

### Visualization
Let's visualize this with an example:

**Example:**
```plaintext
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
```

**Steps:**
1. Initialize `countT = {'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1}`.
2. Initialize `have = 0`, `need = 3`, `res = [-1, -1]`, `resLen = infinity`, and `l = 0`.

**Expand the window:**
1. r = 0, s[r] = 'A' -> `window = {'A': 1}` -> `have = 1`.
2. r = 1, s[r] = 'D' -> `window = {'A': 1, 'D': 1}`.
3. r = 2, s[r] = 'O' -> `window = {'A': 1, 'D': 1, 'O': 1}`.
4. r = 3, s[r] = 'B' -> `window = {'A': 1, 'D': 1, 'O': 1, 'B': 1}` -> `have = 2`.
5. r = 4, s[r] = 'E' -> `window = {'A': 1, 'D': 1, 'O': 1, 'B': 1, 'E': 1}`.
6. r = 5, s[r] = 'C' -> `window = {'A': 1, 'D': 1, 'O': 1, 'B': 1, 'E': 1, 'C': 1}` -> `have = 3`.

**Shrink the window:**
1. `have == need`, update `res = [0, 5]`, `resLen = 6`.
2. l = 1, `window = {'A': 0, 'D': 1, 'O': 1, 'B': 1, 'E': 1, 'C': 1}`, `have = 2`.
3. Continue expanding and shrinking the window...

**Final result:**
After processing all characters, we get the smallest window `[9, 12]` which corresponds to the substring `"BANC"`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum window substring by maintaining a dynamic window that expands and contracts based on the characters in `t`.
