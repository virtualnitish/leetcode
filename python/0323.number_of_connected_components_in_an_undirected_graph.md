# 323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

## Disjoint Set (Union Find) Method

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [1] * size

    def find(self, u):
        if self.parent[u] != u:
            self.parent[u] = self.find(self.parent[u])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[u]

    def union(self, u, v):
        root_u = self.find(u)
        root_v = self.find(v)
        if root_u != root_v:
            # Union by rank
            if self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
            elif self.rank[root_u] < self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_u] = root_v
            else:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
                self.rank[root_u] += 1

def countComponents(n, edges):
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    for u, v in edges:
        uf.union(u, v)
    
    # Count distinct roots
    root_set = {uf.find(i) for i in range(n)}
    return len(root_set)

n = 5
edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]
print(countComponents(n, edges))  # Output: 2
```

### Explanation of the Approach
1. **Union-Find Structure:** We use a Union-Find data structure to keep track of the connected components. This includes two main operations: `find` to determine the root of a node and `union` to join two sets.
2. **Path Compression and Union by Rank:** These optimizations help to keep the tree flat, improving the efficiency of the Union-Find operations.
3. **Counting Components:** After processing all edges, we count the number of unique roots, which correspond to the number of connected components.

### Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(E \cdot \alpha(n))\), where \(E\) is the number of edges and \(\alpha(n)\) is the inverse Ackermann function, which is very slow-growing and almost constant for practical purposes.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\), due to the parent and rank arrays used in the Union-Find structure.

## DFS Method

```python
def countComponents(n, edges):
    graph = {i: [] for i in range(n)}
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)

    def dfs(node):
        stack = [node]
        while stack:
            current = stack.pop()
            for neighbor in graph[current]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    stack.append(neighbor)

    visited = set()
    count = 0

    for node in range(n):
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            dfs(node)
            count += 1

    return count

n = 5
edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]
print(countComponents(n, edges))  # Output: 2
```

### Explanation of the Approach
1. **Graph Representation:** We use an adjacency list to represent the graph. This helps in efficiently traversing the graph.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** We use DFS to explore the graph. When we encounter an unvisited node, we start a new DFS traversal from that node, marking all reachable nodes as visited.
3. **Counting Components:** We keep a count of connected components by initiating a new DFS traversal whenever we encounter an unvisited node.

### Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n + E)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes, and \(E\) is the number of edges. This accounts for traversing all nodes and edges.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\), due to the adjacency list and visited set.
