# 133. Clone Graph

```python
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: Optional['Node']) -> Optional['Node']:
        # Dictionary to save the visited node and its clone
        clone_hash = {}

        def clone(node):
            if not node:
                return None  # Return None if the node is empty
            if node in clone_hash:
                return clone_hash[node]  # Return the clone if already created

            # Create a new node clone
            copy = Node(node.val)
            clone_hash[node] = copy  # Add the clone to the dictionary

            # Recursively clone the neighbors and append to the clone's neighbors
            for nei in node.neighbors:
                copy.neighbors.append(clone(nei))
            return copy

        # Start the cloning process from the given node
        return clone(node)
```

### Explanation of the approach:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: The DFS traversal is used to clone the graph. For each node, a clone is created and stored in `clone_hash` to ensure that nodes are not cloned multiple times, preventing infinite loops.
- **Hash Map**: A dictionary (`clone_hash`) is used to keep track of visited nodes and their corresponding clones. This ensures that each node is cloned only once, and its neighbors are appropriately connected.

### Time & Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges. We visit each vertex and edge once during the traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V), where `V` is the number of vertices. This accounts for the `clone_hash` dictionary and the recursion stack.
