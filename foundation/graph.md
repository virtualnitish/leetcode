# Graph and Graph Traversal Algorithms

## Building and Traversing Graph using Adjacency List

### Adjacency List DFS

#### Recursive

```python
def build_adj_list(edges, n):  # n is the number of vertices
    adj_list = {i: [] for i in range(n)}
    for u, v in edges:
        adj_list[u].append(v)
        adj_list[v].append(u)  # Assuming it's an undirected graph
    return adj_list

def dfs(adj_list, node, visited, result):
    if node not in visited: # Not required if DFS is only called after checking the visited set
        visited.add(node)
        result.append(node)
        for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(adj_list, neighbor, visited, result)

edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)]
n = 7  # Number of nodes

graph = build_adj_list(edges, n)
print("Adjacency List:", graph)

# Perform DFS starting from node 0
visited = set()
result = []
dfs(graph, 0, visited, result)
print("DFS traversal:", result)
```

#### Iterative

```python
def dfs_iterative(adj_list, start):
    visited = set()
    result = []
    stack = [start]

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node not in visited: # Essential check
            visited.add(node)
            result.append(node)
            for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    stack.append(neighbor)

    return result
```

**The Line `if node not in visited:` Before Marking Visited Is Very Very Important.**   

Even though we only add neighbors that haven't been visited to the stack, **a node can be added to the stack before it has been processed (i.e., marked as visited)** from multiple sources.

```
    1
   / \
  2---3
       \
        4
```

In graphs with cycles or multiple paths, a node might get added to the stack by different neighboring nodes before it's actually popped and processed.

**Illustration:**

- Node `2` was connected to both `1` and `3`.
- Both `1` and `3` can add `2` to the stack before `2` is processed.
- Without the `if node not in visited:` check, `2` is processed multiple times and added to the result twice!
- **Final Result:** `[1, 3, 4, 2, 2]`



### Adjacency List BFS

```python
from collections import deque

def build_adj_list(edges, n):
    adj_list = {i: [] for i in range(n)}
    for u, v in edges:
        adj_list[u].append(v)
        adj_list[v].append(u)  # Assuming it's an undirected graph
    return adj_list

def bfs(adj_list, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    visited.add(start)
    bfs_order = []

    while queue:
        u = queue.popleft()
        bfs_order.append(u)
        for neighbor in adj_list[u]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return bfs_order

edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)]
n = 7  # Number of nodes

graph = build_adj_list(edges, n)
print("Adjacency List:", graph)

# Perform BFS starting from node 0
bfs_result = bfs(graph, 0)
print("BFS traversal:", bfs_result)
```


## Shortest Path Algorithm

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def bellman_ford(n, edges, src):
    """
    Computes shortest path from src to all nodes using Bellman-Ford algorithm.
    Returns (distances list, has_negative_cycle flag)
    """
    INF = float('inf')
    dist = [INF] * n
    dist[src] = 0

    # Relax edges (n - 1) times
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        updated = False
        for u, v, w in edges:
            if dist[u] != INF and dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + w
                updated = True
        if not updated:
            break  # Early stop if no changes

    # Check for negative-weight cycles
    for u, v, w in edges:
        if dist[u] != INF and dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
            return [], True  # Negative cycle detected

    # Format unreachable nodes
    dist = [d if d < INF else -1 for d in dist]
    return dist, False

# Example graph
n = 5
edges = [
    (0, 1, -1),
    (0, 2, 4),
    (1, 2, 3),
    (1, 3, 2),
    (1, 4, 2),
    (3, 2, 5),
    (3, 1, 1),
    (4, 3, -3)
]
src = 0

distances, has_negative_cycle = bellman_ford(n, edges, src)
if has_negative_cycle:
    print("Graph contains a negative-weight cycle.")
else:
    print("Shortest distances from node", src, ":", distances)

```

#### ðŸš§ Why **nâˆ’1** Iterations?

In a graph with **n** nodes, the **longest possible simple path** (a path that doesnâ€™t repeat any nodes) contains at most **nâˆ’1 edges**.

Thatâ€™s because any path with **n** or more edges must have visited at least one node twice â€” and hence contains a cycle.

So, the **shortest path to any node** â€” without cycles â€” can be found in at most **nâˆ’1 edge relaxations** from the source. Each iteration potentially adds one more edge to the shortest path you're building.

Thus:
- **1st pass**: explores paths with 1 edge
- **2nd pass**: paths with â‰¤ 2 edges
- ...
- **(nâˆ’1)th pass**: allows up to (nâˆ’1) edges (longest simple path)

By the end of pass `nâˆ’1`, you've explored all possible shortest paths that donâ€™t involve cycles â€” and youâ€™re done.

---

#### â›” What Happens If You Go Beyond `nâˆ’1`?

Thatâ€™s when Bellman-Ford shifts gears â€” and starts detecting negative weight cycles.

Here's what you do:
- After `nâˆ’1` passes, you **do one more pass**.
- If *any* distance improves in that final pass, it means the graph contains a **negative weight cycle** â€” because a shortest path with more than `nâˆ’1` edges implies revisiting nodes and reducing cost repeatedly, which only happens in such a cycle.

So, continuing beyond `nâˆ’1` is useful only to check whether **distance is still decreasing due to a loop** â€” which would violate the well-defined concept of a shortest path.

---

#### ðŸ§  In short

- **`nâˆ’1` iterations**: explore all shortest paths without cycles.
- **1 extra iteration**: detect negative cycles.
- **More than that**: not useful â€” just wastes time or risks infinite loops in naÃ¯ve implementations.


### Dijkstra's Algorithm
[THE CODE IS NOT REVIEWED YET; IT WAS GENERATED BY CHATGPT FOR A QUICK REFERENCE]

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(n, edges, src):
    """
    Computes shortest path from src to all nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.
    Returns distances list.
    """
    INF = float('inf')
    dist = [INF] * n
    dist[src] = 0

    # Build adjacency list with weights
    adj = {i: [] for i in range(n)}
    for u, v, w in edges:
        adj[u].append((v, w))
        # If undirected, also add: adj[v].append((u, w))

    heap = [(0, src)]  # (distance, node)

    while heap:
        d, u = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if d > dist[u]:
            continue  # Already found a better path

        for v, w in adj[u]:
            if dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + w
                heapq.heappush(heap, (dist[v], v))

    # Format unreachable nodes
    dist = [d if d < INF else -1 for d in dist]
    return dist

# Example graph
n = 5
edges = [
    (0, 1, 2),
    (0, 2, 4),
    (1, 2, 1),
    (1, 3, 7),
    (2, 4, 3),
    (3, 4, 1)
]
src = 0

distances = dijkstra(n, edges, src)
print("Shortest distances from node", src, ":", distances)
